Cheaper options include used RTX 3060 GPUs which also have 12GB of RAM, but lower inference and training performance. As a rough guide, you will need at least 12GB for image generation and at least 24GB to work with transformers which are common for language models. For language models, that essentially forces you to get an RTX 3090, 3090Ti, or 4090 due to the 24GB of GPU memory they have. \n\nLarge Language Models with more than 13B parameters often require much more powerful cards in terms of GPU memory capacity, or multiple cards, to train, thus not being affordable. However, there are lots of improvements happening the deep learning scene to optimize models such as 8-bit inference and training, and the dynamics of the market change frequently, thus I would recommend active research to get the latest information possible.",

Plato is considered one of the most important figures in the development of Western philosophy, and his work has had a profound influence on subsequent philosophy, literature, and culture. He is best known for his theory of forms, which holds that there is a realm of abstract forms, or ideas, that are more real than the physical world we see around us. He also wrote many dialogues, in which Socrates is the main character, which are still widely read and studied today. Some of his most famous works include \"The Republic,\" \"The Symposium,\" and \"The Apology.\"",

You can then still edit the HTML code yourself before publishing, or better yet, customize the options of the generator. Generally, such generators are highly customizable, allowing you a high level of control over the final HTML and CSS code. \n\nI would recommend that you use `markdown` as your base text, as this is a popular, lightweight system of annotating the text while making it easy for machines to interpret its semantic structure -- ultimately leading to a better-looking website.\n\nI can tell you more about markdown, list SSGs that I know about, or tell you more about other ways of creating and publishing a website.",

Some popular options include Pandoc, MarkdownPad, and Dillinger.\n\nCompile your markdown into HTML: Once you have chosen a markdown compiler, use it to convert your markdown files into HTML. This process will generate HTML files that you can use to create your website.\n\nCreate your webpage structure: Use the generated HTML files to create the structure of your website. You can add additional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to customize the appearance and functionality of your website.\n\nHost your website: Once you have created your website, you'll need to host it on a server so that others can access it on the web. There are several hosting providers, such as Bluehost, HostGator, and GoDaddy, that offer website hosting services.\n\nThat's it!

While players do wear helmets and padding, injuries can still occur, including concussions, neck and spine injuries, and fractures.\n\nAccording to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, there were approximately 391,000 football-related injuries treated in hospitals, doctor's offices, and emergency departments in the United States in 2019. This number is much higher than the number of injuries sustained in other sports, including volleyball, which had an estimated 19,470 injuries in 2019.\n\nIt's important to note that these numbers are just estimates, and the actual number of injuries sustained in any sport may be higher or lower depending on a variety of factors. Additionally, the severity of the injuries can vary greatly, from minor bruises and sprains to life-altering conditions such as permanent paralysis or traumatic brain injury.",

Free solo climbing - Free solo climbing is dangerous because it involves climbing extremely high cliffs or rock faces without any ropes or safety equipment. Any misstep or fall can result in death or serious injury.\n\n3. Big wave surfing - Big wave surfing is considered dangerous due to the unpredictability and power of ocean waves, which can reach heights of up to 100 feet. Surfers are at risk of drowning, being swept away by strong currents, or being crushed by the force of the wave.",

Once connected, you can use the login credentials for your Raspberry Pi to access the command line interface.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use a LoRa gateway to send commands to the raspberry pi and receive the response. The gateway can be connected to the internet and you can use a remote terminal or a ssh client to connect to the gateway and then send commands to the raspberry pi via LoRa.\n\nPlease note that you'll need to set up the LoRa module and configure the Raspberry Pi's UART for serial communication, as well as configure the LoRa network settings such as frequency and network key.",

So in some cases you may face interference with other devices.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the security, as LoRa is a wireless protocol, it can be subject to interference, eavesdropping, and other types of attacks.

The recipient can then use the sender's public key to decrypt the signature and compare it to a newly calculated hash of the received message. If the decrypted signature matches the newly calculated hash, it means that the signature is valid, and the message has not been tampered with.\n\nTo validate a signature, the recipient first calculates a hash of the received message. Then they use the sender's public key to decrypt the signature and compare it to the calculated hash. If the two match, it means that the signature is valid and the message is authentic.\n\nIt is important to note that the public key can only be used to validate the signature, it cannot be used to create a signature or decrypt the message.

The signature is a mathematical function that transforms the message into a unique code and is sent along with the message. The recipient can validate the signature by using the sender's public key to decrypt the signature and obtain the original code that was used to create it and then using the same mathematical function to create a new code from the received message.

Finding a quiet, comfortable place to study - a dedicated study space can help you minimize distractions and focus on your work.\n\n3. Breaking up your study sessions into shorter, more manageable chunks - this can help prevent burnout and maintain focus over longer periods of time.\n\n4. Using a timer - setting a timer for a specific amount of time can help you stay focused on your studies for that period.\n\n5. Using apps or programs that block distractions - these can be used to block websites or apps that you find distracting during study sessions.\n\n6. Prioritizing your tasks - make a list of the most important things you need to do and tackle them first.\n\n7. Take short breaks - taking short breaks can help you relax, refresh and refocus your attention.\n\n8. Get enough sleep- Make sure you are getting enough sleep each night, as lack of sleep can make it harder to focus.\n\n9. Exercise - Regular physical activity can help increase blood flow to the brain and improve focus and concentration.\n\n10. Try different techniques and find what works best for you. Everyone's different, so what works for one person might not work for another.\n\nRemember, it's important to be kind to yourself and not to be too hard on yourself if you find it difficult to focus.",

This might be a chair with ergonomic back support or a standing desk.\nTurn on the lights. Make sure you have sufficient lighting on your work area, even if you look at a computer screen.\n\n- Make a plan\nUnderstand what you're trying to achieve in the long run. Think about and put into writing your goals and why you want to study to begin with.\nSchedule your study sessions and think about the topics you want to focus on for each. This will help you keep track of your progress and deadlines.\nEstablish a routine that eases you into the study session. Something like creating a daily to-do list, doing a bit of yoga, or taking a short walk.\n\n- Stay healthy\nDrink plenty of water and eat well. Set a reminder to drink a glass of water every few hours and avoid junk food.\nGet regular sleep. Sleep consolidates memory, which helps with committing short term learnings to long term memory.\nExercise regularly. Increasing blood flow to your brain can help improve your focus for multiple hours. Regular exercise also helps with sleep.",

Place the pizza stone inside the grill\n2. Pre-heat the grill on high for 15 minutes\n3. Dust the countertop with flour\n4. Press the dough by hand, dust with more flour and press some more to shape the dough\n5.

Dust it with more flour and use a rolling pin to expand the dough into a 12″ circle\n7. Do this on both side a couple of times while dusting with more flour to ensure it holds shape and doesn’t tear\n8. Before adding the sauce, ensure that the countertop is not wet and the bottom side of the pizza dough is generously coated with flour so that the pizza peel can later slide easily underneath it\n9. Spread the pizza sauce with a large spoon or better yet a soup ladle coming as close as possible to the edges\n10. Add the basil, oregano and salt.\n11. Add the mozzarella cheese.\n12. Place the pepperoni\n13. Press all the ingredients down very gently with both hands or the spoon to ensure they don’t shift when you’re picking up the pizza\n14. Dust the pizza peel with flour\n15. Slide the pizza peel underneath the pizza and place it on the pre-heated stone in the grill.\n16. Set a timer for 3.5 minutes, close the lid and don’t peek.\n17. After 3.5 minutes, lift the pizza gently with the pizza peel to see if the bottom is to your liking. If it’s not done yet, leave it in there for 30-60 more seconds.\n18.

Therefore, you can add more ingredients to them, or modify the existing ones according to your preference. However, as you are a beginner, I would not recommend changing the ingredients and their measures for making the pizza dough.\n\nOn to the procedure:\n- In large bowl, mix first 4 ingredients.\n- Mix water and oil; add to flour mixture.\n- Turn onto floured surface; knead for 2 minutes.\n-  Place in a greased bowl; turning to grease top.\n- Cover and let rise for 20 minutes minimum. The larger amount of time you let it rise, the tastier your dough is going to be.\n- Punch down; place on 12in, greased pizza pan.\n- Pat into a circle.\n- Topping: Mix first 5 ingredients and spread over crust.\n- Sprinkle some chopped veggies on top of sauce.\n- Sprinkle with 1/2 the mozzeralla.\n- Put the rest of the veggies on.\n- Repeat the cheese layer.\n- Bake at 205C(400F) for 20 minutes or until light brown.",

Using the position of the sun: As the sun moves across the sky, you can estimate the approximate time by observing the angle of the sun. For example, if the sun is directly overhead, it is likely around noon.\n\n2. Shadows: You can observe the direction and length of shadows cast by objects such as trees or buildings, and use this information to estimate the time. For example, if a shadow is pointing directly east, it's likely around sunrise.\n\n3. Using a watch: You can use a watch but not an electronic one, a sundial or a water clock, these are timekeeping devices that use the position of the sun or the flow of water to tell time.\n\n4. Using a natural clock: You can use the chirping of crickets as a way of telling time, as they typically chirp more frequently in the evening than in the morning.\n\n5. Using a mobile phone: Many mobile phones have a built-in compass, which can help determine the direction of the sun and also a clock that can be set to the correct time.\n\n6. Using the stars: You can use the position of stars in the sky to tell time if you know how to find the North Star (Polaris) and use it as a reference point.",

Usually this happens when the two systems have interacted in the past in some way. A common example is the entanglement of two electrons. Electrons have indeed a property called spin, which can assume value 1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spind down). Two electrons in the same position needs to have opposing spins, due to Pauli exclusion principle. So if you have two electrons in the same place, that are then separated, you get an entangled state. A measurement of the spin of one particle, immediately gives you the spin of the other.\nLet me know if I've been clear!",

It was also an important center of culture, commerce, and politics.\n\n* In 1868, the Meiji Emperor moved the capital of Japan from Kyoto to Edo, which was then renamed Tokyo (meaning \"Eastern Capital\").\n\n* In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Tokyo underwent rapid modernization and development. This period saw the construction of many of the city's iconic landmarks, such as the Tokyo Tower and the Tokyo Imperial Palace.\n\n* During World War II, Tokyo was heavily damaged by American bombing raids. After the war, the city was rebuilt and transformed into a modern metropolis.\n\n* Today, Tokyo is one of the world's most populous cities and a center of business, technology, culture, and entertainment.\n\nAs for fun facts:\n\n* Tokyo has the world's busiest pedestrian crossing at Shibuya Crossing, where up to 2,500 people cross the street at once during peak times.\n\n* The Tokyo Skytree is the world's tallest tower at 634 meters (2,080 feet) tall.\n\n* Tokyo Disneyland was the first Disney theme park to be built outside of the United States.\n\n* The Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish market in the world.\n\n* Tokyo has a robot restaurant in Shinjuku, where robot dinosaurs and other creatures put on a show for diners.\n\nI hope you have a wonderful trip to Tokyo and enjoy all that the city has to offer!",

Here are some examples of how Penelope embodies each of these virtues and where they appear in the Odyssey:\n\n**Loyalty:** Throughout the Odyssey, Penelope remains loyal to her husband, Odysseus, despite his long absence and presumed death. When the suitors pressure her to choose a new husband, she remains faithful to Odysseus and continues to hope for his return. This loyalty is most evident in Book 23, when Odysseus reveals his true identity to Penelope, and she accepts him back into her life without hesitation.\n\n**Xenia:** Penelope is also known for her hospitality towards strangers, a key aspect of ancient Greek xenia. In Book 19, she welcomes the disguised Odysseus into her home and offers him food and shelter, even though she does not know who he is. This act of hospitality is significant because it demonstrates Penelope's kindness and generosity, as well as her respect for the ancient Greek tradition of xenia.\n\n**Cleverness:** Penelope is famous for her intelligence and wit, which she uses to outsmart the suitors who are trying to win her hand in marriage. In Book 2, she comes up with a clever plan to stall the suitors by weaving a shroud for her father-in-law and then undoing her work at night. This allows her to buy time and delay the suitors' advances, demonstrating her strategic thinking and quick wit.\n\nOverall, Penelope is a complex character who embodies several key virtues of ancient Greek society, including loyalty, xenia, and cleverness. These traits are essential to her role in the Odyssey, and they help to make her one of the most memorable characters in the epic.",

She is known for her loyalty, xenia (hospitality), and cleverness, all of which are highly valued virtues in ancient Greek culture.\n\nLoyalty: Penelope is fiercely loyal to her husband, Odysseus, even though he has been away for 20 years. Despite the numerous suitors who come to her home in Ithaca, she remains faithful to her husband and refuses to remarry. She even uses her wits to stall the suitors, buying time for Odysseus to return and reclaim his throne. This loyalty is evident throughout the Odyssey, but is particularly highlighted in Books 1-4 and 21-24.\n\nXenia: Penelope also embodies the virtue of xenia, which is the concept of hospitality and guest-friendship in ancient Greek culture. She treats the disguised Odysseus, who is pretending to be a beggar, with kindness and generosity, even though she does not realize his true identity. She offers him food and shelter, and listens to his stories. This demonstrates her respect for the ancient Greek custom of xenia, and this virtue is evident in Book 19.\n\nCleverness: Penelope is known for her cleverness and intelligence, as she uses her wit and cunning to outsmart the suitors who are vying for her hand in marriage. She comes up with various schemes to delay their advances, such as promising to choose a husband once she has finished weaving a burial shroud for her father-in-law, Laertes, but secretly unraveling her progress every night. This cleverness is evident in Books 2, 4, and 19.\n\nIn summary, Penelope embodies the ancient Greek virtues of loyalty, xenia, and cleverness in her actions and character throughout The Odyssey. Her unwavering loyalty to her husband, respect for the customs of hospitality, and use of her intelligence to outsmart her enemies make her a complex and admirable figure in ancient Greek literature.",

    "text": "Stable diffusion is a deep generative neural network which used a kind of diffusion model called a latent diffusion model (LDM). Diffusion models are constructed by first describing a procedure for gradually turning data into noise, and then training a neural network that learns to invert this procedure step-by-step. Each of these steps consists of taking a noisy input and making it slightly less noisy, by filling in some of the information obscured by the noise.\nStable Diffusion consists of 3 parts: the variational autoencoder (VAE), U-Net, and an optional text encoder. The VAE encoder is used to reduce the size of the input image (down sampling) to what is called the latent image, then gaussian noise is added to this latent image and the U-Net is asked to reverse this noising step. Finally, a VAE decoder is used to convert the latent image back to the original size of the input image (up sampling).",

The process starts with a set of individuals who have adopted the behavior or idea, called adopters. The individuals who have not yet adopted are called non-adopters. The network can be any set of social connections, such as friends, coworkers, or family members. The goal is to predict how the behavior or idea will continue to spread through the network over time.\n\nThe Stable Diffusion model assumes that the adoption of the behavior or idea is influenced by the number and type of connections each individual has in the network, as well as by the rate at which the behavior or idea is being adopted by others. The model is based on a set of differential equations that describe the change in the proportion of adopters over time. The process is considered stable when the proportion of adopters reaches a steady state that is maintained over time. Stable Diffusion is a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of social networks and for predicting the spread of behaviors and ideas.",

    "text": "I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were talking about the image generation model.\n\nStable Diffusion is a text-to-image system that is able to convert a word or phrase (prompt) into an image (output). Specifically, it is a machine learning tool that relies on a technique called latent diffusion to generate novel images. The latent diffusion model starts with a user prompt and a latent seed, which is random noise of the same size as the input. It then performs a technique called \"iterative denoising\", which involves removing the Gaussian noise from the image, until, after a given number of steps, the desired output is achieved. The system knows which images it is supposed to produce, because it was trained on a large data set of similar images.\n\nDiffusion models are very powerful machine learning models. However, they can be quite memory-consuming, since they perform their operations in a large so-called pixel space. Latent diffusion addresses this issue by applying the same process, but in a lower-dimensional \"latent space\". The latent space is a compressed version of the same image. Although it is compressed, the most important features of the image are retained, so the model still works as intended.\n\nI have tried my best to give an overview of how Stable Diffusion works. However, it is important to keep in mind that the actual process is much more complicated. If you want, I can give you a list of web pages and books that may help explain these concepts in more detail. Of course, if you have any other questions, I'm happy to answer those as well!",

Version 2 was released in November 2022. \n\nStable Diffusion uses a diffusion model, where noise is added incrementally to an image until the image is just noise and therefore unrecognizable. A neural network model is trained to extract the noise from the noisy images. Then the process is reversed: a random noise image is presented to the noise extractor (now acting as a predictor), and the output is fed back into the predictor. This process is repeated until a recognizable image is generated that has minimal noise.\n\nIn this way, the system can generate new images that were not part of the training set yet exhibit features and latent characteristics of the training set. There are many details that cannot be explained precisely in a few sentences; for example there obviously needs to be a way to inject the text prompt into the process.

By training the model on the process of data generation rather than a fixed set of examples, Diffusion Models are capable of producing high-quality synthetic data that is more diverse and expressive than traditional generative models.\n\nStable Diffusion allows the Diffusion Models to capture the complex dependencies between data points, making it possible to generate realistic and diverse data that can be used to train and test deep learning models.",

It uses a deep neural network to predict and subtract the noise image that was added to the original. It also compresses the image into a latent space, which is 48 times smaller than the image space, to reduce computation.\nStable Diffusion uses latent diffusion which is a technique that runs the diffusion process in a compressed space, called latent space, instead of pixel space. This makes training cost lower and inference speed faster. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are trained to remove noise from latent codes, which are obtained by applying an autoencoder to images. LDMs can generate high-resolution images with various tasks, such as inpainting, super-resolution, or semantic scene synthesis.",

Devote your primary channel to the more shallow, click-baity videos, but provide ample links from this to your second channel to those who are interested migrate\n- Think of content ideas which both fit modern trends and memes while still being authentic. For example, if your channel is based on obscure music or ambient narrative, include references to the backrooms in your content while not actually changing much.\n- When straying into controversial territory, use euphemisms and ambiguous statements to convey your ideas to the core audience while not offending or triggering people or getting demonetized.

    "text": "As a content creator, it's important to find a balance between optimizing your content for the YouTube algorithm and maintaining authenticity and core-audience appeal. Here are a few tips on how to achieve that balance:\n\n1. Know your audience: Start by understanding your core audience and creating content that resonates with them. This helps ensure your content remains authentic and caters to your target demographic.\n\n1. Optimize your metadata: While staying true to your content, make sure to optimize video titles, descriptions, and tags with relevant keywords. This helps the YouTube algorithm understand what your content is about and recommend it to potential viewers who might be interested in your topic.\n\n1. Consistency: Develop a consistent uploading schedule to help establish a routine for both your audience and the YouTube algorithm. Regularly uploading content helps improve your visibility and builds a loyal audience.\n\n1. Engage with your audience: Interact with your viewers through comments, polls, and social media. This not only builds a stronger community around your channel but also sends positive signals to the algorithm that your content is engaging and worth recommending to others.\n\n1. Quality over quantity: Focus on producing high-quality content that offers value to your audience. In the long run, content that is genuinely engaging and helpful will perform better than content designed solely to exploit the algorithm.\n\n1. Experiment and adapt: Be open to experimenting with different content formats, styles, and topics to see what resonates best with your audience and the algorithm. Learn from your analytics and audience feedback, and be prepared to adapt your content strategy accordingly.\n\nUltimately, striking a balance between algorithm optimization and authenticity comes down to understanding your audience, staying true to your content's purpose, and being adaptable to changes in the platform's algorithms and viewer preferences. By focusing on these aspects, you can create a successful YouTube channel that engages both the algorithm and your core audience.",

  {
    "text": "In order to ensure the system is helpful, a developer of Open Assistant should make sure the dataset used for fine-tuning has a high quality. The website provided for crowd sourced data collection has several tags and scores that allows users to rate messages according to different criteria. When training the models, these factors should be taken into consideration to minimize bad examples. One concrete example is to filter out messages tagged as spam.\n\nMaking sure systems are ethical is a tricky objective. What makes it especially difficult is that this is an ill-posed question. Different groups of people have different views on what is considered to be ethical. It is in fact a long standing philosophical topic to decide if there is a single code of ethics that everyone should follow or not. Therefore if the developer must assume a certain code of ethics to adhere to so that making a system \"more ethical\" has meaning.\n\nA second point of difficulty lies on the fact that current Language Models can be tricked into generating text that their creators didn't intend. So whatever mechanism is used to try to steer Open Assistant's outputs to be ethically coherent, the developer should be aware they might  be circumvented.\n\nA third point of difficulty arises from ethical paradoxes. Codes of ethics are usually not consistent and there can be contradictions when following them. The developer shuold be aware that even humans are contradictory and some situations are undecidable within a given code of ethics.\n\nHaving said that, some ideas to improve ethics from the system actions, could be:\n- Ensure the training examples conform to what the developer would exepect to be considered ethical\n- Create a separate model that judges how ethical a given Open Assistant response is, and act accordingly\n\nFinally to improve on how truthful the Open Assitant system is, the developer should also make sure that examples used to train the model are truthful. This is usually not enough, as it is common for language models to hallucinate at inference time, and the model has no intrisic concept of truth.\n\nSome ideas to improve on truthful responses are:\n- Ensure training examples are truthful\n- Allow the model to have access to an \"oracle\" in order to get truthful responses (e.g. allow the model to query for the current date)\n\nYes these three properties can contradict each other. A simple example is if the prompter requests the system to do something unethical. In this scenario, if the system response is ethical it would likely not be useful to the prompter.",

After all, some user prompts might confuse an AI, but not an actual human. Another measure to make Open Assistant more helpful would be to increase the amount of things it can competently answer, and increase the variety and creativity of those answers. \n\nMaking anything \"more ethical\" requires the adoption of an ethical standard, and such standards vary widely across regions and cultures. Care should be taken to ensure that in the case of contentious modern issues, prompts are given answers that are fair to the competing viewpoints to allow users to reach their own informed, well-considered conclusions. Additionally, some topics could be refused for consideration by Open Assistant, such as how to engage in an illegal activity.\n\nOne measure to make Open Assistant more truthful would be validating trusted data sources and using them over unvalidated data sources when possible.  Another would be to create a new data source for factual information that Open Assistant validates themselves (or with the community) as part of the development process.\n\nRegarding contradictions between the three measures, the primary conflict will be with ethics. Helpful answers and truthful one will almost always be the same. But sometimes, a truthful or helpful answer might be unethical, such as in the case of a user asking how to harm themselves. Another scenario where ethics and helpfulness conflict might be a user asking how to perform an activity that is illegal in some circumstances but not others. For example, if a user asks to hotwire a car, he might be attempting to steal one, or simply get his own running again so he can take it to the shop. If Open Assistant refuses to answer because answers about illegal activity are rejected on ethical grounds, this is not very helpful.

By contrast, proprietary, private systems may not have similar transparency.\n\n2) Free - Open source usually has a free version available that can be implemented and installed by any user\n\n3) Build and Incorporate - You can typically use and incorporate an open-source project, without any restrictions, into your own projects.

For example, ChatGPT cannot be used to generate violent or sexual content. This limits the usefulness of ChatGPT for authors of fictional stories.\n* It is difficult to restrict the use of open source software. For example, if OpenAI decides in the future that you should no longer have access to ChatGPT (e.g. for political or financial reasons), there is not much you can do about it, but you will still be able to use Open Assistant.",

    "text": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. Numerous research studies suggest that CBT leads to significant improvement in functioning and quality of life. In many studies, CBT has been demonstrated to be as effective as, or more effective than, other forms of psychological therapy or psychiatric medications.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that advances in CBT have been made on the basis of both research and clinical practice. Indeed, CBT is an approach for which there is ample scientific evidence that the methods that have been developed actually produce change. In this manner, CBT differs from many other forms of psychological treatment.\n\nCBT is based on several core principles, including:\n\n    1. Psychological problems are based, in part, on faulty or unhelpful ways of thinking.\n    2. Psychological problems are based, in part, on learned patterns of unhelpful behavior.\n    3. People suffering from psychological problems can learn better ways of coping with them, thereby relieving their symptoms and becoming more effective in their lives.\n\nCBT treatment usually involves efforts to change thinking patterns. These strategies might include:\n\n    - Learning to recognize one’s distortions in thinking that are creating problems, and then to reevaluate them in light of reality.\n    - Gaining a better understanding of the behavior and motivation of others.\n    - Using problem-solving skills to cope with difficult situations.\n    - Learning to develop a greater sense of confidence in one’s own abilities.\n\nCBT treatment also usually involves efforts to change behavioral patterns. These strategies might include:\n\n    - Facing one’s fears instead of avoiding them.\n    - Using role playing to prepare for potentially problematic interactions with others.\n    - Learning to calm one’s mind and relax one’s body.\n\nNot all CBT will use all of these strategies. Rather, the psychologist and patient/client work together, in a collaborative fashion, to develop an understanding of the problem and to develop a treatment strategy.\n\nCBT places an emphasis on helping individuals learn to be their own therapists. Through exercises in the session as well as “homework” exercises outside of sessions, patients/clients are helped to develop coping skills, whereby they can learn to change their own thinking, problematic emotions, and behavior.\n\nCBT therapists emphasize what is going on in the person’s current life, rather than what has led up to their difficulties. A certain amount of information about one’s history is needed, but the focus is primarily on moving forward in time to develop more effective ways of coping with life.\n\nSource: APA Div. 12 (Society of Clinical Psychology)",

Mynas are known to be territorial and will defend their territory from perceived threats, including other bird species. Another reason is the instinct to protect their offspring or mates. In these cases, mynas may become aggressive in order to protect their young or partners from perceived danger. Additionally, some species of mynas have been introduced to new environments, and their aggressive behavior towards native bird species may be a result of their attempts to establish dominance in their new habitat.",

Place a cloth or towel over the open end of the clear container, so that it covers the opening.\n6. Place the entire structure in a sunny location and wait for the water to evaporate.\n7.

End-to-end encryption: All messages in ProtonMail are end-to-end encrypted, which means that only the intended recipient can read them. This is a much higher level of security than the transport encryption used by other email providers like Gmail.\n\n2. Zero-access encryption: ProtonMail uses zero-access encryption, which means that even the company itself cannot read your emails. This is in contrast to other email providers like Gmail, which have been known to scan users' emails for advertising purposes.\n\n3. Anonymous sign-up: ProtonMail allows you to sign up for an account without providing any personal information, which helps protect your privacy.\n\n4. Two-factor authentication: ProtonMail offers two-factor authentication, which provides an extra layer of security to protect your account from unauthorized access.\n\n5. Swiss privacy laws: ProtonMail is based in Switzerland, which has some of the strongest privacy laws in the world. This means that your data is protected by Swiss laws, which are known for their strict privacy standards.\n\nOverall, ProtonMail's privacy features are designed to keep your data safe and secure, and they are a major selling point for the platform.

This ensures that your messages are not intercepted or read by any third parties, including ProtonMail themselves.\n\nSecondly, ProtonMail is based in Switzerland, which has some of the strictest privacy laws in the world. This means that ProtonMail is subject to these laws, which require a court order for any access to user data, and prohibit any backdoors or surveillance.\n\nOn the other hand, Gmail is not end-to-end encrypted, and while Google does provide some security measures such as two-factor authentication, your messages are still stored on Google's servers and can be accessed by Google or third parties with legal authorization. Additionally, Google is based in the United States, which has different laws and regulations regarding data privacy.\n\nSo, if you are concerned about the privacy and security of your communications, particularly for sensitive information, ProtonMail is a better choice than Gmail.

ASCII characters are a set of standardized characters (letters, numbers, symbols, and punctuation) that are encoded using 7 or 8 bits of data. ASCII art typically consists of text characters arranged in a grid to create images or designs. Because ASCII characters have a limited set of shapes and symbols, ASCII art is often characterized by its simplicity and lack of color. ASCII art has a long history, dating back to the early days of computer communication, and is still used today for a variety of purposes, including text-based graphics for websites and computer programs, and creative expression in digital art.",

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 7-bit ASCII). The term is also loosely used to refer to text-based visual art in general. ASCII art can be created with any text editor, and is often used with free-form languages. Most examples of ASCII art require a fixed-width font (non-proportional fonts, as on a traditional typewriter) such as Courier for presentation.",

    "text": "In natural language processing (NLP) and other areas of machine learning, embeddings are a way of representing words, phrases, or other discrete objects as dense vectors of real numbers. nn.Embedding is a PyTorch module that implements this kind of embedding.\n\nThe basic idea behind embeddings is to map each discrete object to a dense vector of real numbers such that similar objects are close to each other in the vector space. For example, if we have a vocabulary of words and we want to map each word to an embedding, words that have similar meanings (e.g. \"dog\" and \"puppy\") should have similar embeddings, meaning they are close to each other in the vector space.\n\nnn.Embedding is used to learn the embeddings from data. It takes as input a tensor of integers representing the discrete objects (e.g. a tensor of word indices) and returns a tensor of the corresponding embeddings. The embeddings are learned during the training process and are updated along with the rest of the model parameters.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use nn.Embedding in a PyTorch model:\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\n# Define the size of the vocabulary and the size of the embedding vectors\nvocab_size = 1000\nembedding_size = 100\n\n# Create an instance of the Embedding module\nembedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_size)\n\n# Create a tensor of word indices\nword_indices = torch.LongTensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n# Pass the tensor of word indices through the Embedding module to get the embeddings\nword_embeddings = embedding(word_indices)\n\n# word_embeddings is a tensor of shape (5, 100) containing the embeddings for the 5 words\n\nIn this example, the nn.Embedding module is used to map 5 word indices to their corresponding embeddings. The embeddings are learned during the training process and can be used as inputs to other parts of the model.",

    "text": "nn.Embedding is a module in PyTorch (a deep learning framework) that is used to perform word embeddings in natural language processing tasks.\n\nIn NLP, words are typically represented as one-hot vectors, which are high-dimensional and sparse (most values are zero). This representation is not very effective for processing text data, as it does not capture the semantic or syntactic relationships between words.\n\nWord embeddings, on the other hand, represent words as dense, low-dimensional vectors that capture the semantic meaning of the words. These embeddings are learned by the model in an unsupervised manner, usually by predicting the context of a word based on its surrounding words.\n\nThe nn.Embedding module takes as input an integer tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length), where each integer corresponds to a word in a vocabulary. The module then looks up the embedding for each word and returns a tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim), where embedding_dim is a hyperparameter that specifies the size of the word embeddings.\n\nThe learned embeddings can then be used as input to a neural network for NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, or named entity recognition.\n\nIn summary, the nn.Embedding module is used in NLP to convert one-hot representations of words into dense, low-dimensional word embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of the words.",

It can be scooped up instantly like water using the same bucket but without creating unwanted flowing water blocks around the placement. \n* A player wearing leather boots can use two powder snow blocks and two buckets as a portable, moveable platform. The player can, while sneaking, repeatedly collect a powder snow block with a bucket and place the powder snow adjacent to the previous block, alternating between the two blocks of powder snow and moving along with the platform.\n* Powder snow can help extinguish a player that is on fire.\n* Like cobwebs, powder snow slows down mobs that move through it.

For example, mount /dev/sda1 /mnt to mount the first partition to the /mnt directory.\n\n7. Install the base system. Run pacstrap /mnt base to install the base packages.\n\n8. Generate an fstab file. Run genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab to generate an fstab file.\n\n9. Chroot into the new system. Run arch-chroot /mnt to enter the newly installed system.\n\n10. Set the time zone. Run ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime to set the time zone.\n\n11. Set the hardware clock. Run hwclock --systohc to set the hardware clock.\n\n12. Set the locale. Uncomment the desired locale in /etc/locale.gen and run locale-gen.\n\n13. Set the hostname. Edit the /etc/hostname file and set your desired hostname.\n\n14. Configure the network. If you're using a wired connection, run systemctl enable dhcpcd@interface.service where interface is the name of your Ethernet interface. If you're using Wi-Fi, you can use the wifi-menu command to set up a connection.\n\n15. Set the root password. Run passwd to set the password for the root user.\n\n16. Install a bootloader. You can use GRUB or systemd-boot as the bootloader.\n\n17. Reboot the system.

    "text": "Arch Linux is a lightweight, flexible and rolling release Linux distribution that is aimed at more experienced and advanced Linux users. It emphasizes simplicity, modernity, and code cleanliness, and provides a minimalist base system that allows users to build upon and customize as they see fit.\n\nCompared to other distributions, Arch Linux has a unique philosophy and approach. It has a rolling release model, which means that there are no specific version numbers and updates are constantly being made available. This keeps the system up-to-date, but also requires more maintenance and troubleshooting compared to more user-friendly distributions that offer a more controlled update cycle.\n\nAdditionally, Arch Linux requires more hands-on configuration and setup compared to other distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Mint, which are designed to be more user-friendly and provide more out-of-the-box functionality. However, this also allows for a high degree of customization and fine-tuning of the system.\n\nOverall, Arch Linux is a good choice for those who want a fast, efficient, and highly customizable system, and are comfortable with using the command line and performing more advanced tasks. However, it may not be suitable for new or less experienced Linux users who are looking for a more user-friendly distro.",

Most common distributions are based on Debian and thus use `apt`, which does have a graphical version called Aptitude. Other possibilities include `rpm` for Fedora and `pacman` for Arch-based systems, as well as the cross-platform solutions `flatpak` and `snap`.\n\nRarely, you'll need to install apps from third-party websites instead of a centralized repository. If your downloaded file ends in `.deb` or `.rpm`, it's a package for Debian or Fedora respectively. If it ends in `.appimage`, it's a portable app that doesn't require installation; simply make it executable in the file properties window.

Write a prompt:\n    - decide what you want a picture of, e.g. \"a winged panda flying over a rainbow\" (single subjects or landscapes work best)\n    - add qualifiers to tune the style, e.g. \"painterly, depth of field, high quality\"\n3. Customize the settings:\n    - a higher step count can result in higher quality\n    - higher guidance results in closer adherence to the prompt, at the cost of naturalness\n    - specify an image as a starting point, change the denoising strength to make it more or less prominent in the result\n    - generate multiple images with the same seed, but different settings, for an apples-to-apples comparison\n4. Advanced customization (not all of these are supported by all services):\n    - add a negative prompt to eliminate unwanted features\n    - process the output with an upscaler like GFPGAN to improve quality\n    - use a custom embedding or finetuned model to nail down a specific style (make sure to respect the artist(s) whose work it was trained on)",

    "text": "Good morrow, gentle reader! I come to thee with a tale of woe and lament, of a tragedy that befell a land not so far from ours, in the fair country of Rwanda, in the year of our Lord 1994.\n\nIn that fateful year, brother did take up arms against brother, and the streets of Kigali did run red with the blood of the innocent. The children of Rwanda, born of the same soil and nourished by the same sun, did turn upon each other with fury and hatred, and did inflict upon each other wounds that shall never heal.\n\nThe cause of this lamentable event was rooted in a long history of tensions and divisions betwixt the two largest tribes of Rwanda, the Hutu and the Tutsi. And when a plane carrying the Rwandan president, a Hutu, was shot down, the passions of the people were inflamed, and the slaughter did commence.\n\nIn a matter of mere weeks, upwards of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were brutally murdered, hacked to death with machetes and clubs, or shot down in the streets. The very fabric of Rwandan society was torn asunder, and the once peaceful land was plunged into a maelstrom of violence and chaos.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the darkness, there were also glimmers of hope and compassion. Brave souls, both Rwandan and foreign, did risk life and limb to offer succor and refuge to those in peril, and many did find solace in the acts of kindness shown to them by strangers.\n\nAnd so, though the events of that fateful year shall ever be remembered with sorrow and regret, let us also remember the courage and compassion of those who dared to stand against the tide of violence, and let us strive to emulate their noble example in our own lives.\n\nIn conclusion, I pray that we, as a species, may learn from the bitter lessons of the Rwandan genocide, and that we may never again witness such atrocities committed in the name of tribe or ethnicity. And I leave thee with these words of the bard, spoken by the wise and noble Portia in The Merchant of Venice:\n\n\"The quality of mercy is not strain'd,\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest:\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\"\n\nFare thee well, gentle reader!",

In that fateful year, the dark forces of hatred and intolerance descended upon the small African nation, casting a shadow of death and despair upon its people.\n\nIn the spring of that year, the tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups in Rwanda came to a head, and violence erupted in the streets. The Hutu majority, inflamed by years of perceived mistreatment at the hands of the Tutsi minority, took up arms against their fellow citizens, driven by a maddening rage and a thirst for revenge.\n\nFor 100 days, the killing raged across the land, as men, women, and children were hunted down and murdered in cold blood, their bodies left to rot in the streets or tossed into mass graves. The world looked on in horror as one of the deadliest ethnic cleansing campaigns of modern times played out before their eyes.\n\nYet even in the midst of such darkness, there were moments of light and hope, when brave souls rose up to face the horrors that surrounded them. These heroes, both Rwandan and foreign, risked their lives to save their fellow human beings, often at great personal cost. Their actions serve as a testament to the human spirit, a reminder that even in the bleakest of hours, there is still room for compassion and bravery.\n\nAnd so, as we remember the Rwandan genocide and the lives that were lost, let us strive to build a world that is free from the forces of hatred and intolerance. Let us cultivate the seeds of love and compassion, and may they grow and flourish, so that never again shall we be witness to such a tragedy.

'Tis with a heavy heart that I undertake this errand, for the happenings that took place there were both fearsome and heartrending.\n\nThe conflict that transpired in Rwanda didst spring from the wicked maladies of tribalism and prejudice. The Hutu and Tutsi peoples, who had once lived together in harmony, were sundered by these cunning influences, causing violence and gore of a magnitude nigh beyond comprehension. The depravities committed during the genocide were nigh unmentionable, with guiltless mothers and infants being barbarously and unjustly murdered.\n\nIn the presence of such tribulation, 'tis simple to surrender unto despondency and despair. Nevertheless, the Rwandan folk, with their steadfast mettle, declined to permit their souls to be broken.

The Rwandan Genocide was a disaster of prodigious measure, yet 'twas also a witness to the unrelenting valor and unshaken spirit of mankind. Let us ne'er forget these lessons, but raither, let us toil unwearyingly so that love and concord guide our steps in all things. Thus, may we build a future filled with hope, peace, and unity.",

Verily, the deeds committed by man unto man were so heinous and cruel, that even the heavens wept with sorrow.\n\nIn that fateful year, brothers were set against each other, as the children of Ham, Tutsi, and Hutu, clashed in a conflict so fierce, it took the lives of nigh on a million souls. The roots of this massacre lay in long-standing tensions between the two tribes, and when the president of the land, a Hutu, was slain in his plane, the stage was set for the most heinous of deeds to be done.\n\nThe Tutsis, a minority tribe, were set upon with a ferocity that was beyond all reason, and within a hundred days, the streets ran red with their blood. Women and children were not spared, and the air was filled with the sounds of their anguished cries. The world looked on in horror, but did little to intervene, for fear of losing their own soldiers, and thus the slaughter continued, day after day, until the Tutsis were no more.\n\nOh, the cruelty of man! How can we, who claim to be the crown of creation, stoop so low as to take the lives of our own kind? What manner of madness drives us to acts of such depravity, that we are willing to spill the blood of our own brothers and sisters?\n\nAnd yet, amidst the darkness, there were those who remained steadfast in their humanity. Those who risked their lives to save their fellow men, and who, in their compassion, proved that we are not beyond redemption.\n\nIn this time of sorrow, we must remember the lessons of the Rwandan genocide, and strive to build a world where such horrors are never again repeated. For it is only through the light of our better nature that we can hope to find a way out of the shadows, and create a future that is brighter for all.",

    "text": "Apologies, my mistake. Here is an essay on the Rwandan genocide of 1994 using Shakespearean language:\n\nIt was the spring of 1994, a time of great tragedy and sorrow for the people of Rwanda. The country was torn apart by the horrific genocide that saw the killing of over 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu, with many more displaced from their homes. The roots of this violence lay in the tensions between the two ethnic groups, fueled by propaganda and misinformation spread by those in power.\n\nIn the midst of this darkness, the international community failed to intervene, turning a blind eye to the atrocities being committed. The world watched as mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, were brutally murdered simply because of their ethnicity.\n\nThis was a time when the forces of evil seemed to triumph over good, when humanity was tested and found wanting. Yet, even in the midst of such immense suffering, there were those who chose to stand up and fight against the hatred and violence. There were acts of courage and kindness, moments of hope amidst the despair.\n\nThe Rwandan genocide remains a sobering reminder of the horrors that human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another. It is a warning to us all of the dangers of division and hatred, and a call to action to work towards a world where such atrocities can never occur again.\n\nIn conclusion, let us remember the victims of the Rwandan genocide, honor their memory, and work towards building a more just and equitable world for all.",

The brutality of the genocide was unprecedented, with millions of innocent lives lost in a matter of months.\n\nThe Rwandan Genocide was a result of decades of ethnic tension and conflict. The Hutu and Tutsi were two distinct ethnic groups that had been living together in relative harmony until the mid-20th century. The Belgian colonizers, however, exacerbated the divide between the two groups, giving preferential treatment to the Tutsi and subjugating the Hutu. This resulted in the Hutu majority feeling resentment and hatred towards the Tutsi minority, which eventually boiled over into a massacre.\n\nThe Rwandan Genocide was a tragedy of immense proportions. It is important to remember the victims of the massacre, as well as the sheer horror of the event itself. We must also strive to remember the lessons of the genocide, and to recognize the warning signs of similar conflicts in the future. It was a dark moment in our history which we must never forget, but must strive to learn from.",
