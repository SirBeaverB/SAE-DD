However, a good place to start might be to create a design document. The design document should outline the core gameplay, level design, and major features of the game, such as events, items, locations, bosses etc, as well as a plan to create them within your available time and resources.\n\n\nHere are some suggestions based on this particular story.\n1) As the story is based around exploration of an abandoned civilization, it may be a good idea to create a game that places emphasis on exploration as a core feature, such as in the Metroidvania genre.\n2) It may be beneficial to look for inspiration in existing games that offer similar themes. For example, Super Metroid and Hollow Knight are both exploration focused Metroidvania games about exploring abandoned civilizations. Other games to look to may be: The Zelda series, for it's exploration focus similar to Metroidvanias, Halo, as a game about exploring the ruins of an abandoned alien civilization and inheriting their legacy as the \"Reclaimers\", or Nier Automata, as a game with an android protagonist in a post apocalyptic setting.\n3) As the story particularly mentions Zara's abilities as an android and the theme of inheriting the alien civilization's technology, it may be appropriate to have collectable abilities for Zara scattered throughout the map as \"alien inheritance\", similar to the powerups Samus finds on the Planet Zebas in Super Metroid, or items found in dungeons in the Zelda series. Alternatively, as an android, perhaps the alien technology could be presented in a manner similar to the chip system found in Nier Automata, a notable analog to skill trees.\n4) The story mentions that Zara and her teammates \"encountered hazardous terrains, unexpected weather conditions, and hostile creatures.\" These can be used as gameplay elements. \n* Games in the family of Metroidvania and Zelda-likes often feature a \"lock and key\" design, wherein obstacles block progression until the correct item or powerup is found to overcome the obstacle, and progress into the new area. Hazardous terrains and unexpected weather can act as the \"locks\" in your level design. \n* Alternatively, unexpected weather could play a role as a dangerous event, such as the rain event found in \"Rain World\" that forces the player to seek shelter, or the role of rain in Zelda Breath of the Wild, where the rain event modifies mechanics and prompts the player to play in a different way, engaging with new systems they might not otherwise have noticed.\n* Finally, \"hostile creatures\" could translate to enemies in the context of a videogame. The creatures wandering through the remnants of alien civilization would serve as your game's primary enemy type, possibly including influences from the alien civilization in their design. Hostile creatures notable enough that they were mentioned in the story may also imply that they are boss encounters when adapted into a videogame setting.\n4) The story features four protagonists, Zara as well as the other three researchers. When adapted to a videogame, this could imply a party based RPG system where the three researchers are in your party, such as the type popularized by the Final Fantasy series. Alternatively, Zara's group could split up upon reaching the Planet Niv, and the researchers would play the role of important NPCs to be encountered throughout the world, likely offering some kind of service, such as an item shop or map data. Encountering an NPC could also be part of events and story lines, for example, you may team up with an NPC to fight a specific boss, where they offer a unique mechanic to the boss encounter such as throwing bombs for you to hit the boss with, or engaging it's vulnerability phase. Again, it is beneficial to look to existing games for guidance, I recommend Hollow Knight as particularly adept at introducing engaging, well written NPCs in a Metroidvania setting.\n5) Gaining the ability to translate and understand the final alien may make for a good overarching, long term quest and the ultimate goal of the game. This could be presented as a \"find the MacGuffin\" type task, where you would gather several items to complete the game. For example, fragments of some kind of Rosetta Stone like MacGuffin are scattered throughout the map, and you need to overcome challenges in each area to collect them all and finally gain the ability to translate the alien's message.\n\nIn all, adapting a story into a videogame is a large and non-trivial task, with many options and decisions to be made.

The oauth2_scheme is used to retrieve the token from the request headers.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this in the Linux terminal.\n\n1. Install GraalVM: First, you need to install GraalVM on your machine. This can be done by downloading the GraalVM distribution and following the installation instructions. (Herzog comment: \"The installation process is a journey into the unknown, a leap of faith into the abyss of technological progress.\")\n\n2. Set the PATH environment variable: Once GraalVM is installed, you need to set the PATH environment variable to point to the GraalVM installation directory. This can be done by adding the following line to your bashrc file: export PATH=/path/to/graalvm/bin:$PATH. (Herzog comment: \"The PATH environment variable is the threshold between the mortal realm and the ethereal world of computing.\")\n\n3. Compile the Java application: With GraalVM installed and the PATH environment variable set, you can now compile your Java application to a native executable using the GraalVM compiler. This can be done by running the following command: native-image --no-fallback -cp /path/to/application.jar. (Herzog comment: \"The GraalVM compiler is a formidable tool, a sculptor of digital reality.\")\n\n4. Run the native executable: Once the compilation process is complete, you can run the native executable by executing the binary file generated by the GraalVM compiler. (Herzog comment: \"The native executable is a living organism, a product of human ingenuity and divine inspiration.\")\n\nAnd there you have it, my friend, a step-by-step guide on how to compile a Java application to native with GraalVM in the Linux terminal.

When it comes to family vacations, there are many incredible destinations that can offer a sense of adventure, while still being safe and accessible for children. Here are a few of my top picks, along with some stories from my own travels:\n\n1. Machu Picchu, Peru: This ancient Incan city is nestled in the mountains of Peru, and offers stunning views, fascinating history, and plenty of hiking opportunities. I once spent several days hiking the Inca Trail with a group of fellow adventurers, and the experience was truly unforgettable. We got to see the sunrise over the ruins of Machu Picchu, and explore some of the lesser-known trails and sites around the area.\n\n2. Angkor Wat, Cambodia: This massive temple complex is one of the most impressive and well-preserved ancient sites in the world. I visited Angkor Wat with a group of fellow archeologists, and we spent several days exploring the various temples and structures, marveling at the intricate carvings and intricate architecture.\n\n3. Petra, Jordan: This ancient city, carved into the rock face, is a must-see for anyone interested in history and archeology. I visited Petra with my family a few years ago, and we spent several days exploring the various tombs, temples, and monuments in the area. The highlight of our trip was a hike up to the famous \"Monastery,\" a massive structure carved into the rock face that offers breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.\n\n4. Bagan, Myanmar: This ancient city is home to thousands of Buddhist temples and pagodas, and offers a truly unique and unforgettable experience. I visited Bagan several years ago, and spent several days exploring the various temples and monuments, watching the sunrise and sunset over the vast temple fields, and getting to know the local people and culture.\n\n5. Easter Island, Chile: This remote island, located off the coast of Chile, is home to some of the most mysterious and fascinating ancient ruins in the world. I visited Easter Island with a group of fellow explorers, and we spent several days exploring the various moai statues and other structures, learning about the history and culture of the Rapa Nui people, and enjoying the beautiful natural landscape of the island.\n\nThese are just a few of the many incredible destinations that offer a sense of adventure and excitement for families.

As an archaeologist and explorer, I've been fortunate to visit many unique and exciting destinations around the world. I'd be happy to recommend some off-the-beaten-path destinations that are family-friendly and offer a sense of adventure.\n\nOne place that immediately comes to mind is the lost city of Petra in Jordan. This ancient city was carved into the rock by the Nabateans more than 2,000 years ago and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The walk through the narrow gorge, known as the Siq, to reach the Treasury, which is one of Petra's most famous structures, is an adventure in itself. The Treasury is truly awe-inspiring with its intricate carvings and intricate details. I highly recommend taking a guided tour to learn about the history and culture of the Nabateans and their engineering and architectural marvels.\n\nAnother exciting destination is Machu Picchu in Peru. This 15th-century Incan citadel is located high in the Andes Mountains and offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The trek to reach Machu Picchu, either by hiking the Inca Trail or taking a train and bus, is a great adventure for families. Along the way, you can learn about the Incan culture and their amazing engineering and architectural skills.\n\nIf you're looking for a more tropical destination, I recommend the ancient ruins of Tikal in Guatemala. This Mayan site is located in the middle of the jungle and is known for its towering pyramids and beautiful temples. It's an excellent place for families to explore the ancient structures and learn about the Mayan culture. In addition, the surrounding jungle is home to a variety of exotic wildlife, making it an exciting destination for kids.\n\nLastly, if you're looking for an adventure close to home, I recommend exploring the national parks in the United States. Yellowstone National Park is a fantastic option for families, with its geothermal features and diverse wildlife. Kids will love seeing Old Faithful erupt and exploring the many hiking trails.\n\nI hope these recommendations have given you some ideas for your next family adventure.

This can lead politicians to prioritize the interests of these donors over those of their constituents, or to engage in corrupt practices such as accepting bribes or kickbacks.\n\nAnother factor is the intense pressure to win elections and maintain power, which can lead politicians to engage in unethical or corrupt behavior in order to gain an advantage over their opponents. Additionally, the political system itself can be corrupting, as politicians may become desensitized to unethical behavior over time and begin to view it as a necessary means to an end.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that not all politicians are corrupt or selfish. Many enter politics with a sincere desire to serve the public and make positive change, and work hard to maintain their integrity and uphold ethical standards. However, the pressures and incentives of the political system can create a challenging environment that can be difficult for even the most well-intentioned politicians to navigate.

However, during her labour, it became apparent that Peter was quite a big baby and, due to this, they took his mother to theatre to monitor her progress.\nPeter\u2019s head was delivered first, but due to his size, his shoulders became stuck (shoulder dystocia). Multiple attempts were made to deliver his body, including the use of a ventouse (vacuum cup) and forceps. The McRoberts position (a manoeuvre often used in this situation) was not adopted, nor was an episiotomy.\nIt was unclear from the records how long there was between the delivery of Peter\u2019s head and his body, but the degree of trauma our client suffered to his head and neck was disproportionate to the amount of traction required to deliver a baby, even under these very difficult circumstances.\nWhen Peter was born, he was floppy and not breathing on his own, so he needed help from machines. He also had a wound to his head as a result of the attempted delivery.\nPeter recovered fairly well in NICU and was breathing independently. However, a lump on the side of his neck was noted and, after further investigation, it was found that he had suffered a severe brachial plexus injury that affected the nerves found at C5, C6 and C7. \nDuring the first 10 years of his life, our client underwent five separate procedures to try and improve the long-standing impact of his birth injuries, all of which only helped a little.

The atmosphere is made up of gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen, and when sunlight enters the atmosphere, it gets scattered in all different directions by the gases. However, blue light is scattered more than other colors because it has a shorter wavelength, which means it bounces around more when it interacts with the air molecules.\n\nSo, when we look up at the sky, we see mostly the blue light that has been scattered in all directions, giving the sky its blue hue.

King Fungus was known throughout the land for his love of cheese and his ability to grow mushrooms that could sing.\n\nOne day, while King Fungus was out picking mushrooms, he stumbled upon a small frog who was wearing a top hat and carrying a cane. The frog introduced himself as Sir Hopsalot, and he claimed to be the greatest dancer in all the land.\n\nKing Fungus was intrigued by Sir Hopsalot's claims and decided to hold a dance competition to see if the frog was telling the truth. The competition was held in the middle of the kingdom, and all of the citizens came out to watch.\n\nThe first contestant was a giant snail who could move at lightning speed. Despite his impressive speed, the snail's dance moves were a bit slow and sluggish, and the audience was not too impressed. The second contestant was a group of singing flowers who could harmonize perfectly. The flowers' dance moves were graceful and elegant, but they lacked the energy and excitement of the other contestants.\n\nFinally, Sir Hopsalot took to the stage. As soon as Sir Hopsalot began to dance, everyone knew that he was indeed the greatest dancer in all the land. His moves were so incredible that they caused flowers to bloom and birds to sing. The audience was in awe of Sir Hopsalot's performance, and King Fungus was thoroughly impressed.\n\nJust when everyone thought the competition was over, another dancer stepped onto the stage. This dancer was a mysterious figure, shrouded in a cloak, and no one knew who it was. The mysterious dancer began to move, and everyone was stunned by the skill and grace of the dance. The dance was so incredible that it even seemed to rival Sir Hopsalot's performance.\n\nAs the mysterious dancer continued to dance, Sir Hopsalot grew increasingly nervous. He had never faced such a worthy opponent before, and he was afraid that he might lose the competition. But Sir Hopsalot was determined not to let the mysterious dancer beat him. He began to dance with all his might, moving faster and more gracefully than ever before.\n\nIn the end, Sir Hopsalot emerged as the winner of the competition. The mysterious dancer was revealed to be a magical unicorn, who had come to the kingdom to test Sir Hopsalot's dancing skills. The unicorn was so impressed with Sir Hopsalot's performance that it decided to bless the kingdom and make sure that the citizens were always happy and content.\n\nKing Fungus was so impressed with Sir Hopsalot's performance that he declared him to be his new advisor.

Each letter in the word is represented by a colored box, and the player's task is to guess the word by typing in a five-letter word that they think might be the correct one. After each guess, the game will highlight the letters that are correct in green, and the letters that are in the correct position in yellow.\n\nHere are some basic strategies for playing Wordle:\n\n1. Start with common words: At the beginning of the game, it's best to start with common five-letter words that are easy to guess, such as \"apple,\" \"house,\" or \"water.\" This will help you get a sense of how the game works and what to look for.\n\n2. Use the process of elimination: After each guess, pay attention to the letters that are correct and try to eliminate words that don't contain those letters. This will help you narrow down your choices and increase your chances of guessing the correct word.\n\n3. Look for patterns: As you make more guesses, try to look for patterns in the letters that are correct or in the positions of the letters. For example, if the first letter is always a vowel, you can focus on guessing words that start with a vowel.\n\n4. Use word association: When you're stuck, try to think of words that are associated with the letters that you know are correct. For example, if the word contains the letters \"B\" and \"R,\" you might think of words like \"braid\" or \"brave.\"\n\n5. Don't guess randomly: While it's tempting to guess random words when you're running out of time, this strategy is usually not very effective. Instead, try to make an educated guess based on the letters that you know are correct and the patterns that you've observed.\n\nOverall, Wordle is a fun and addictive game that can help improve your vocabulary and word-guessing skills.

The power afforded by strong gravitational lensing allows us to observe fainter and\nsmaller galaxies than in blank fields.

They were also known for their advanced knowledge, trade routes, and cultural and technological achievements.\n\nSome specific accomplishments and evidence of their cultural and technological achievements include:\n\n- Beer-making: Many Native American groups mastered beer-making in antiquity, and recent research has shown that the Southwestern Pueblos, previously thought to have stayed sober until the 16th century arrival of the Spanish, actually brewed a weak corn beer called tiswin. This was discovered through the analysis of 800-year-old pottery shards, which showed the same residue commonly created during beer fermentation.\n- Political power: By the time 1100 rolled around, a couple of thousand people lived in Chaco Canyon, and they were at their cultural zenith and had political power over a vast area. They even had roads linking them with other Pueblo communities, indicating trade and communication.\n- Timber harvesting: The Anasazi's impressive buildings were made of stone and wooden beams, and archaeologists wondered from where the desert nation got their timber. Trees and weather provided the answer. Each location\u2019s weather is different and uniquely influences a region\u2019s tree growth rings.

Job displacement and unemployment: As AI systems become more advanced and capable, they could displace human workers from a wide range of industries, leading to job loss and unemployment. This could exacerbate existing economic inequality and contribute to social unrest.\n\n1. Fair distribution of benefits: The productivity gains from AI-driven automation may disproportionately benefit a small group of individuals or companies, exacerbating wealth inequality. Ensuring that the benefits of AI are fairly distributed is an important ethical challenge.\n\n1. Skill gaps and retraining: As AI replaces certain jobs, new opportunities may emerge that require different skill sets. Addressing the skill gaps and providing retraining and educational opportunities for displaced workers is crucial to help them adapt to the changing job market.\n\n1. Bias and discrimination: AI systems can inherit biases from their training data or algorithms, which can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in hiring, promotion, or performance evaluation. Ensuring that AI-driven systems are transparent, auditable, and free from bias is essential.\n\n1. Privacy and surveillance: AI technologies may enable more extensive workplace surveillance and monitoring, raising concerns about worker privacy and autonomy. Balancing the benefits of data-driven insights with the need to respect individual privacy is a key ethical challenge.\n\n1. Power dynamics: The widespread adoption of AI in the workplace may shift power dynamics between workers, employers, and technology providers, with potential negative consequences for workers' rights, autonomy, and bargaining power.\n\n1. Human dignity and purpose: Replacing human jobs with AI may undermine the sense of purpose and dignity that many individuals derive from their work.

The strength of the private key depends on the difficulty of solving a certain mathematical problem related to the elliptic curve, which is known as the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). \n\nNow, the ECDLP is way more complicated than other mathematical problems used in other methods of key generation, like the integer factorization problem used in RSA. This makes it much harder to solve using brute force attacks. \ud83d\ude20\n\nTo put it simply, the ECDLP requires solving a set of complex equations involving points on an elliptic curve, which is way more computationally intensive than factoring large integers. \ud83d\udcbb\n\nAnd the best part? ECC keys are shorter than RSA keys of equivalent strength, which makes them more efficient and faster to use! \ud83d\ude80\n\nSo, in summary, the strength of ECC lies in the difficulty of solving the ECDLP, which is much harder than other mathematical problems used in other methods of key generation.

For example, you can use a media query to apply different styles to a page when viewed on a mobile device compared to a desktop device. Here's an example:\n\ncss\nCopy code\n/* Apply these styles for devices with a maximum width of 768px */\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n  /* CSS styles go here */\n}\nUse a flexible grid system: A grid system allows you to organize the layout of your page into rows and columns. A flexible grid system allows these rows and columns to adjust to different screen sizes, making it easier to create a responsive layout. There are several popular grid systems available, such as Bootstrap and Foundation.\n\nUse flexible units for sizing: Instead of using fixed units like pixels, you can use relative units like percentages or em to size your elements. This allows your page to scale proportionally to different screen sizes.\n\nUse images with max-width: 100%: To prevent images from overflowing their containers on smaller screens, you can set the max-width property of the image to 100%. This ensures that the image scales down to fit its container.\n\nBy using these techniques, you can create a responsive layout that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.

A transformer model is a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Google in 2017. It's called a transformer because it's based on the idea of self-attention, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input when processing it.\n\nThe transformer architecture is primarily used for tasks such as natural language processing (NLP) that involve sequential input, such as text. The model is composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes in the input sequence and produces a set of hidden states, which are then passed to the decoder to produce the output sequence.\n\nOne key component of the transformer model is the self-attention mechanism. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when processing it. The model does this by computing a set of attention weights, which are used to weigh the contribution of each input element to the output.\n\nAnother important component of the transformer model is the use of multi-head attention. Multi-head attention allows the model to attend to multiple parts of the input at once. This improves the model's ability to understand relationships between different parts of the input.\n\nIn the original paper the transformer was compromised from an \"encoder\" component and a \"decoder\" component. The input of the encoder is the the embedding of a conditioning text, such as a question, or text meant to be translated to a different language. The decoder receives the output of the encoder and the tokens it generated so far. It then predicts the next token to generate.\n\nFinally, the transformer model also uses positional encoding, which encodes the position of each element in the input sequence. This allows the model to understand the order of the input elements, which is important for tasks like language understanding.\n\nif you have more questions, feel free to ask!", "label_value": 0.75, "index": 28423}, {"text": "Could you give a general overview (assume I'm a software developer who knowns nothing about ML) of how the decoder and encoder actually work?", "label_value": 0.75, "index": 28424}, {"text": "Transformers are a type of neural network that excels at tasks involving sequence data, such as natural language.

It is also one of the safest forms of power generation and does not require large amounts of rare earth metals and fabrication unlike solar panels.\n- Nuclear fusion: Research is ongoing to figure out the viability of nuclear fusion as a power source but it has shown the most potential for sustainable, reliable and safe energy production.\n\nI hope this helps you to better understand the importance of clean energy and spurs you on to do more research on the subject.\n\nSincerely,\nYour colleague", "label_value": 0.6666666666666666, "index": 31199}, {"text": "That's just a list of 5 power sources.

Fusion energy:\nLadies and gentlemen, we've finally made it to the dawn of a new era - fusion power. It's clean, it's virtually unlimited and it's basically free! But let's not get too carried away, we still need to keep the price artificially high for our shareholders, otherwise, we won't get the funds to commercialize fusion. Because, you know, nothing says progress like making something free but selling it for a hefty profit.\n\n2. Nuclear energy:\nNuclear power, a concept once feared and shunned, has now become a safer and more reliable source of energy. Thanks to advancements in technology, we can now use less reactive alternatives to plutonium and uranium, like thorium or deuterium-tritium. But don't let the facts fool you, we still recommend shutting down nuclear. After all, why trust decades of research and development when you can rely on a sensationalized HBO docu-series brought to you by the likes of Comcast, The Vanguard Group and BlackRock.\n\n3. Wind, solar and hydro:\nWind and solar energy, the dynamic duo of renewable energy! While a single wind turbine or solar panel may not make a significant impact on a developed nation's power demand, the power lies in numbers. Just imagine a few hundred thousand windmills and a couple of million panels! And when combined with a hydroelectric dam, we can counteract the weakness of energy production being at its highest outside of peak demand hours by pumping water up in the dams to be used later. It may not be efficient, but it works! And who cares if the panels and turbines need constant maintenance, it means more jobs and more money for the shareholders. Yes, migratory birds may get killed by the wind turbines and have their migratory paths disrupted, but hey, you gotta break a few eggs to make an omelette, right? Besides, the birds seem to love our turbines. They're like big trees in the sky. I've even seen a seagull build its nest on one!\n\n4. Geothermal Energy:\nGet ready to invest in a geothermal power plant! Hold on to your drills, we're about to go deep into the Earth with geothermal energy! It may set you back a pretty penny at the start, but once it's up and running, the ongoing costs are as low as the sulfur gasses fuming from the big holes we drill. All we do is stick some probes down and search for some warm rocks, and if luck is on our side and we don't trigger any earthquakes in the process, the steam turbines will start cooking and we'll have the powa! Ah, the simple life of tapping into the Earth's natural heat.\n\n5. Bioenergy:\nEmbrace the power of yesterday's leftovers and today's wasted food with Bioenergy! Chop down a few trees, mix the wood chips with some agricultural waste, and you've got the energy equivalent of dinosaur bones from millions of years ago. Don't worry about conservation, just replant the trees you cut down. And if you run out of wood chips, there's always more trees and crops to be grown, or better yet, just use food waste as fuel. Who cares if people are going hungry, it's sustainable energy!

The total number of objects in both pyramids is:\n\n$$2\\left(1+2+3+\\dots+\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)$$\n\n$$= n(n/2-1)$$\n\n$$= \\frac{n(n-2)}{2}$$\n\nAdding the top row with $n$ objects, we get:\n\n$$T_n = \\frac{n(n-2)}{2}+n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n\nThus, we have shown that the equation $T_n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ holds for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nYou can run this code in an online LaTeX processor like Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) or sharelatex (https://www.sharelatex.com/).", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 31318}, {"text": "In many sports, better aerodynamics are a serious advantage (at least at the professional level).\nAssuming bald people are more aerodynamic than non-bald people, do you think baldness should be considered a form of doping?", "label_value": 0.85, "index": 31320}, {"text": "What about for swimmers?

On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \"Leo\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat\u00edas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[9] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[10] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[11][12]\n\n\"When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.\"\n\u2013 Newell's Old Boys youth coach Adri\u00e1n Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[13]\n\nA lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of '87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[14][15] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[16] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[17][18] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I've ever seen\".[19]\n\n\nMessi enrolled at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, aged 13.\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[17][20] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mar\u00eda Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[14][20][21]\n\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\u00e9.[22] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[23] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[22][24] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la m\u00e1scara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[25] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\u00e0bregas and Piqu\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 31866}, {"text": "Can you try to summarize it in only one sentence?", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 31868}, {"text": "I'm going to be completely honest with you.

Bring arrows or Infinity", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 31917}, {"text": "How do I need to build an End portal?", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 31924}, {"text": "To answer your question, you don't need to build an End Portal.\n\nThe End Portal is generated as soon as you create you Minecraft world, and it is hidden underground. There are not specific coordinates or a map to it, the generation of the End Portal is unique to each Minecraft world seed.\n\nTo find it you need Ender Eyes, it is recommended that you have at least 10 or more. The Ender Eyes are made with:\n\n1. Ender Pearls which are obtained by beating an Enderman, the chances of that mob dropping this item upon defeat are 1 in 2 (50%). Endermans spawn usually at night time, and are found in plains or desserts.\n\n2. Blaze powder, which is obtained by crafting Blaze Rods; this is made by placing the Blaze Rods in only one of the grid squares. The Blaze Rods are obtained by beating the Blaze mobs, which are found in the Nether. To access the Nether, you need to make an Obsidian Portal which takes 10 Obsidian blocks minimum and Flint and Stone to enable it. Once in the Nether you will need to locate a nether fortress which is where the Blazes spawn, and you will need to defeat enough of the Blazes to gather at least 10 Blaze Rods. The probability of this mob dropping this item is also 1 in 2 (50%).\n\n3. Once you have these items, use a crafting table, and Place the Ender Pearls and the Blaze Powder next to each other horizontally (e.g.: if the top left square is 1, and next to that square at its right, there is the square 2, so place the Ender Pearls in 1 and the Blaze Powder in 2). With this you will craft Ender Eyes.\n\n\nOnce you have the Ender Eyes, this item will help you locate the Ender Portal and also activate it. To find the portal you should be in an open space, then with the Ender Eyes selected, right-click on them; one Ender Eye should leave your hand and it will go up and towards a direction; the Ender Portal is located following that direction. Follow the Ender Eye, and 2 things could happen here, the first one is that the Ender Eye drops from above and you should go to retrieve it and collect it again. The second thing that could happen is that once the Ender Eye has followed its path it will shatter and despwan, this has a 2/10 (20%) probability of happening. Once you throw the first Ender Eye, and are in the same position as the last Ender Eye that you dropped, throw another one, if you throw the Ender Eye and it only goes up without following a direction and a path, it means that you are in the Ender Portal location, however, if the Ender Eye keeps moving in a direction following a path, follow that path and retrieve the Ender Eye if possible, keep doing this until the former thing mentioned happens.\n\nOnce in place, you will have to dig down until you find the \"Stronghold\", which is the structure where the End Portal is located. You will recognize this structure because is built with a distinctive block, stone bricks. Once in the Stronghold, you will need to locate the End Portal. As I mentioned before, there are no specific coordinates given that each seed is unique, and while the Ender Eyes do locate the Ender Portal, it is not completely exact. The Stronghold is designed kind of like a maze, so you will need to explore it to find the Ender Portal. While exploring you may find many valuable items in chests scattered around the Stronghold.\n\nOnce you find the Ender Portal, you will see that the blocks that make the Portal have a hole in the middle, and depending on your seed there are 3 possibilities (the last one being really unlikely), the first one and the most probable is that some of the Ender Portal blocks will have and Ender Eye and some of them will be empty (the distribution of this may vary depending on the seed), the second one is that all of the blocks will be empty which has a 28% chance of happening, and finally, the third one is that all of the blocks already have an Ender Eye, meaning that the portal should be active, this has a 1 in 1 trillion possibilities of happening. \n\nSo given the most common cases, once in the Ender Portal, locate the blocks that don't have an Ender Eye, go around the Portal, and while pointing to the block, left-click with the Ender Eye selected, this should add the Ender Eye to that block. Repeat this for all the empty blocks. One thing to note is that this is the reason why it is recommended to have at least 10 Ender Eyes, given that a portal in Minecraft is minimally composed by 10 blocks, however naturally generated portals in Minecraft like the End Portal will always have only 10 blocks.\n\nOnce all the Ender Eyes are placed, the Ender Portal will be active, and you can now access the End. Be aware that once you access the End the only way out without losing your items is by defeating the Ender Dragon, which is a difficult task if you are not prepared.\n\nI hope that my answer helps you find the End Portal!

The EU has its roots in the aftermath of World War II, when European leaders sought to promote greater cooperation and integration among the countries of the continent in order to prevent future wars. In 1951, the European Coal and Steel Community was established, followed by the establishment of the European Economic Community in 1957.\n\nThe EU has grown over the years and has evolved into a complex organization that seeks to promote cooperation, integration, and stability among its member countries. The EU is now responsible for a wide range of policies, including economic and monetary policies, trade, agriculture, and environmental protection.\n\nOne of the major challenges facing the EU is the ongoing economic crisis in Europe, which has led to high levels of unemployment, economic hardship, and social unrest in many of its member countries. The EU has responded to these challenges by implementing a series of economic reforms and by providing financial support to its struggling member countries.\n\nAnother challenge facing the EU is the ongoing migration crisis, which has put pressure on the EU's ability to maintain the free movement of people and goods within its borders. The EU has struggled to find a coordinated and effective response to the migration crisis, and this has put strain on its relationship with its member countries and has led to tensions among its leaders.\n\nDespite these challenges, the EU continues to play an important role in the global political and economic landscape. The EU is the world's largest economic bloc, and it is a major player in international trade and diplomacy. The EU is also a key member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and other major international organizations.\n\nIn terms of its influence on other major international organizations and countries, the EU is widely seen as a model for regional integration and cooperation. The EU has encouraged other regions of the world to pursue similar goals of integration and cooperation, and it has played a leading role in promoting peace and stability in Europe and around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, the EU faces a number of challenges as it works to promote cooperation, integration, and stability among its member countries. These challenges include the ongoing economic crisis, the migration crisis, and tensions among its leaders.

Dimensions of the pinhead: We would need to know the size of the pinhead on which the angels are dancing, specifically the surface area available for the angels to occupy.\n\n2. Size of an angel: Since angels are mythical or supernatural beings, there is no standardized size or shape. We would need to assume a size for the angels in order to calculate how many can fit on the pinhead.\n\n3. Shape of an angel: The shape of an angel would also be relevant, as different shapes would occupy space differently on the pinhead. For simplicity, we could assume that angels are uniformly shaped (e.g., circular, square, etc.).\n\n4. Dancing style and space requirements: We would need to consider how much space each angel requires to dance, which would depend on their dancing style and any additional room needed for movement.\n\n5. Overlapping or layering: We would need to determine if the angels can overlap or be layered on top of each other, which would significantly affect the number of angels that can fit on the pinhead.\n\n6. Supernatural properties: Since angels are supernatural beings, they may not be constrained by the same physical rules as ordinary objects.

It is, in  principle, the first Turing-complete machine to ever be designed, meaning it could, in theory, solve every Turing-computable function.\n\nIn summary, the history of programmation is wide and has been added upon by many people, attributing the merit to a single person wouldn't be fair to the thousands that added upon the technology.", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 32667}, {"text": "give me some goals to aim for in a Minecraft survival world", "label_value": 0.5833333333333334, "index": 32684}, {"text": "Sure, here are some goals to aim for in a Minecraft Survival World:\n\n1.

He caught himself being rude to his classmates and interrupting them. But every time he did, he apologized and tried to make it right. Slowly, his classmates began to see a change in him. They started talking to him and inviting him to sit with them at lunchtime.\n\nLaerte felt a sense of joy that he had never felt before. He had never realized how much happiness and fulfillment came from being kind to others. As the days went on, he found himself going out of his way to help his classmates with their work, listening to their problems, and even making them laugh.\n\nBy the end of the school year, Laerte had transformed into a new person. He was kind, compassionate, and humble. His classmates had become his friends, and he felt a sense of belonging that he had never felt before. He had learned that true success wasn't just about being smart or talented, but about being a good person.\n\nLaerte looked back at his old self and cringed at the thought of how he used to behave.

As a result of these accords, the fate of Europe was irrevocably altered, setting the stage for the advent of World War II.\n\nThe Munich Agreements were the outcome of a series of diplomatic negotiations between the major European powers of the time, including Germany, Britain, France, and Italy. At the heart of these negotiations was the issue of the Sudetenland, a region in Czechoslovakia inhabited by a significant German population. The German leader, Adolf Hitler, sought to annex the Sudetenland and incorporate it into the German Reich.\n\nIn an effort to avoid conflict, the leaders of Britain, France, and Italy agreed to Hitler's demands, in the belief that this would appease the German leader and preserve peace in Europe. The accords, signed on September 29, 1938, granted Hitler the right to occupy the Sudetenland, effectively undermining the sovereignty of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Munich Agreements have been the subject of much criticism and controversy, with many historians arguing that they represented a failure of leadership on the part of the British and French. Critics argue that the accords represented a betrayal of the principles of collective security and international law, as the leaders of Britain and France capitulated to Hitler's demands, thereby emboldening the German leader and increasing the likelihood of war.\n\nMoreover, the Munich Agreements have been seen as a turning point in the history of Europe, marking the moment when the appeasement policy of the Western powers reached its zenith. The accords effectively ensured the collapse of Czechoslovakia and the partition of Europe into two spheres of influence, with Hitler's Germany dominating the continent.\n\nIn the final analysis, the Munich Agreements serve as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the dangers of appeasement and the importance of standing up to tyranny and aggression. They also serve as a testament to the importance of leadership, as the decisions made by the leaders of Britain, France, and Italy in 1938 had far-reaching consequences for the entire continent. As we reflect on the legacy of the Munich Agreements, it is essential that we remain vigilant in our efforts to preserve peace and security in Europe, and to ensure that the lessons of the past are not forgotten.", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 33077}, {"text": "Don't use phrases like \"In conclusion\", graduate students don't write like that.", "label_value": 0.75, "index": 33086}, {"text": "Please give me some examples of recently-discovered biological species or higher-order taxa that had a big impact on the scientific community.", "label_value": 0.6363636363636364, "index": 33088}, {"text": "Interesting!

With a soft purr and a twinkle in her eye, she offered to help him find his way home.

The joke was on her, because it turns out her cousins all spoke Portuguese.  They were nice enough about it, and kept on speaking English for her visit - but on account of that and the way she complained about the heat they did start calling her Silly instead of Chilly.  \nIf you're in Rio and you're speaking Spanish - or English, or both for that matter - you're going to miss a lot of what goes on and there's people you won't be able to talk to.  Silly Pepper had this problem in the airport when she was trying to get back home.  A well-meaning stranger who thought he knew what she was talking about pointed her to the wrong plane, and she got off of it in Juneau Alaska.  She could tell it was totally the wrong place immediately because it was January and the plane landed in the daytime.  Where Silly was from, Daytime doesn't happen in January.   Also?  Trees.  Antarctica's sort of given up on trees.  \n\nAnyhow, she was stuck in the airport because she hadn't done the paperwork to walk around loose in America, and she met someone else who had a similar problem.  Croc O'Dyle had been visiting relatives in America but he hadn't done his paperwork either. They were trying to deport him but didn't know whether to send him to Ireland or Australia and he wasn't telling.  Silly on the other hand spent several hours a day explaining in great detail exactly where she wanted to be deported to, and they didn't seem interested.  The third night she was there, Silly and Croc tried to drink each other under the table, and it was a tie.  Next morning, when they were getting over their hangovers they promised each other that if one of them figured out how to get something better and/or cheaper than airport liquor, they'd let the other have some. \n\nAnyway, they did a news story about her and she got her picture in the local news.  That's when someone realized she looked a lot like old Auntie Auk, who'd passed away the previous year, and some reporters started snooping and eventually worked out that they were actually related.  Not very closely, but Auntie Auk had died without leaving a will, and being related got Silly the complete and undivided attention of a half-dozen half-psychotic auklings who were fighting over the estate.  They hadn't agreed on anything in fifteen years but they were one hundred percent together on wanting her gone, immediately, leaving each of their lawyers a letter that said she didn't want any inheritance from the estate.   She held out for one case of booze from each of the half-dozen half-psychotic auklings, to be delivered to Croc after she was gone, and they had her on a plane out of there before the end of the day.\n\nCroc didn't quite know what to do with a half-dozen cases of some of the most eyewateringly expensive wine he'd ever even heard of.  He didn't quite know what Silly had done to get it delivered to him.  He couldn't quite believe these half-psychotic auklings were such complete idiots that they didn't know what it was worth.  So he called a wine broker and a lawyer and an immigration attorney.  He sold most of the wine and got himself on the road to naturalized American citizenship, which turns out to be really easy when you have a few hundred million dollars and no criminal record.  He bought a little farm in Louisiana not far from where his cousins lived, and further north, each and every one of a half-dozen half-psychotic auklets never ever admitted to any of the others that they'd stolen their case of booze from Auntie Auk's estate.  As their fight dragged out over the following decade they eventually realized there was way less money in that estate than they'd thought there must be, and drank dry the bitter dregs of their own disappointment.\n\nBut he inquired around before he left, eventually discovering that one of the local bush pilots had been hired to take Silly out to one of the Aleutian islands at night and tell her it was Antarctica.  And that wouldn't do, he thought.  After all, it was only February, and she'd know right off when the sun rose that it wasn't time yet for morning.  So he sold another bottle of wine and hired that pilot to go right back out there and pick her up, then fly her all the way to Antarctica and tell her it was the Aleutian Islands.\nSeveral days later, somewhere a thousand miles or so south of the Farallons, Silly Pepper walked into her own house and asked what continent it was on.", "label_value": 0.6666666666666666, "index": 33150}, {"text": "the penguin is dead.", "label_value": 0.6666666666666666, "index": 33151}, {"text": "Thank you!
