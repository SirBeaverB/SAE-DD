I come to thee with a tale of woe and lament, of a tragedy that befell a land not so far from ours, in the fair country of Rwanda, in the year of our Lord 1994.\n\nIn that fateful year, brother did take up arms against brother, and the streets of Kigali did run red with the blood of the innocent. The children of Rwanda, born of the same soil and nourished by the same sun, did turn upon each other with fury and hatred, and did inflict upon each other wounds that shall never heal.\n\nThe cause of this lamentable event was rooted in a long history of tensions and divisions betwixt the two largest tribes of Rwanda, the Hutu and the Tutsi. And when a plane carrying the Rwandan president, a Hutu, was shot down, the passions of the people were inflamed, and the slaughter did commence.\n\nIn a matter of mere weeks, upwards of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were brutally murdered, hacked to death with machetes and clubs, or shot down in the streets. The very fabric of Rwandan society was torn asunder, and the once peaceful land was plunged into a maelstrom of violence and chaos.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the darkness, there were also glimmers of hope and compassion. Brave souls, both Rwandan and foreign, did risk life and limb to offer succor and refuge to those in peril, and many did find solace in the acts of kindness shown to them by strangers.\n\nAnd so, though the events of that fateful year shall ever be remembered with sorrow and regret, let us also remember the courage and compassion of those who dared to stand against the tide of violence, and let us strive to emulate their noble example in our own lives.\n\nIn conclusion, I pray that we, as a species, may learn from the bitter lessons of the Rwandan genocide, and that we may never again witness such atrocities committed in the name of tribe or ethnicity. And I leave thee with these words of the bard, spoken by the wise and noble Portia in The Merchant of Venice:\n\n\"The quality of mercy is not strain'd,\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\nUpon the place beneath.

Here are some of the most popular ones:\n\n    Andrew's Algorithm: This is a sweep line algorithm that sorts the points by their x-coordinate, and then scans the points from left to right while maintaining a monotone chain. The monotone chain is updated using binary search, which takes O(log n) time, where n is the number of points in the chain. The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n).\n\n    Graham's Scan: This is another sweep line algorithm that sorts the points by their polar angle with respect to the leftmost point. The algorithm then scans the points in order, and removes points from the stack if they create a non-convex angle. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n).\n\n    Chan's Algorithm: This is an improvement on Graham's scan that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort the points by their polar angle. The algorithm takes O(n log n) time, and has a better constant factor than Graham's scan, which makes it faster in practice for large inputs.\n\n    Jarvis March (also known as Gift Wrapping): This is an incremental algorithm that starts from the leftmost point and repeatedly finds the point that is closest to the current hull. The algorithm takes O(n^2) time in the worst case, but can be optimized to take O(n log n) time by using a binary search tree to find the closest point.\n\n    QuickHull: This is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that starts by finding the extreme points (the leftmost, rightmost, topmost, and bottommost points), and then recursively divides the set of points into two convex hulls. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n) on average, and O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, the most efficient algorithms are Andrew's, Graham's and Chan's, with a time complexity of O(n log n). The Jarvis March and QuickHull algorithms are also viable options, but their worst-case time complexity is higher, at O(n^2).", "label_value": 0.375, "index": 10002}, {"text": "Computing the lower vestigial hull of a cluster of items P in the flatland (R^2) can be done expeditiously utilizing one of the following approaches:\nGraham Scan process: This process is a brutish force approach which entails sorting the items in P in ascending order of their y-coordinates, and then applying a left-to-right scan for the lower hull. The time complexity of the Graham scan process is O(N log N).\nMonotone Chain practice: This is a more speedy approach to computing the lower vestigial hull, which includes sorting the items in P in ascending order of their x-coordinates, and then constructing the lower hull in a left-to-right scan. The time complexity of the Monotone Chain practice is O(N).\nDivide and Conquer procedure: The Divide and Conquer approach involves splitting the cluster of items in P into two halves, computing the hulls of the left and right halves, and then merging the outcomes in linear time. The time complexity of the Divide and Conquer procedure is O(N log N).\nIn general, the Monotone Chain practice is the most expeditious approach for computing the lower vestigial hull of a cluster of items P in the flatland (R^2) in terms of time complexity, and it has a time complexity of O(N).

It sounds like you have a general idea for a YA novel involving a teenager uncovering a criminal conspiracy, but you would like help fleshing out the details and structure using the Hero's Journey. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Let's start with clarifying the different stages of the Hero's Journey: The Hero's Journey typically consists of several stages, including the Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing the Threshold, Tests/Allies/Enemies, Approach to the Innermost Cave, Ordeal, Reward, Road Back, and Return Home. We can work through how each of these stages might play out in your specific story. Do you have a sense of what the Ordinary World for your protagonist might look like?\n\n2. What can you tell me about your protagonist? Developing compelling characters is essential to an effective Hero's Journey. Who is your protagonist? What are their key traits, goals, and motivations? How will they change over the course of the story? Thinking through the details of your main character will help in mapping out their journey.\n\n3. Let's discuss the key plot points in your story: In addition to the Hero's Journey stages, a compelling story needs key plot points, obstacles, stakes, and resolution. What key events will your protagonist encounter? What obstacles will they face in uncovering the conspiracy? What are the stakes if they fail? How will the story ultimately be resolved? Discussing the plot details will help ensure there is sufficient conflict and resolution in your story.\n\n4.

During the GFC, a downturn in the US housing market was a catalyst for a financial crisis that spread from the United States to the rest of the world through linkages in the global financial system. Many banks around the world incurred large losses and relied on government support to avoid bankruptcy. Millions of people lost their jobs as the major advanced economies experienced their deepest recessions since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Recovery from the crisis was also much slower than past recessions that were not associated with a financial crisis.\n\nMain Causes of the GFC\nAs for all financial crises, a range of factors explain the GFC and its severity, and people are still debating the relative importance of each factor. Some of the key aspects include:\n\n1. Excessive risk-taking in a favourable macroeconomic environment\nIn the years leading up to the GFC, economic conditions in the United States and other countries were favourable. Economic growth was strong and stable, and rates of inflation, unemployment and interest were relatively low. In this environment, house prices grew strongly.\n\nExpectations that house prices would continue to rise led households, in the United States especially, to borrow imprudently to purchase and build houses. A similar expectation on house prices also led property developers and households in European countries (such as Iceland, Ireland, Spain and some countries in Eastern Europe) to borrow excessively. Many of the mortgage loans, especially in the United States, were for amounts close to (or even above) the purchase price of a house. A large share of such risky borrowing was done by investors seeking to make short-term profits by \u2018flipping\u2019 houses and by \u2018subprime\u2019 borrowers (who have higher default risks, mainly because their income and wealth are relatively low and/or they have missed loan repayments in the past).\n\nBanks and other lenders were willing to make increasingly large volumes of risky loans for a range of reasons:\n\nCompetition increased between individual lenders to extend ever-larger amounts of housing loans that, because of the good economic environment, seemed to be very profitable at the time.\nMany lenders providing housing loans did not closely assess borrowers\u2019 abilities to make loan repayments. This also reflected the widespread presumption that favourable conditions would continue. Additionally, lenders had little incentive to take care in their lending decisions because they did not expect to bear any losses. Instead, they sold large amounts of loans to investors, usually in the form of loan packages called \u2018mortgage-backed securities\u2019 (MBS), which consisted of thousands of individual mortgage loans of varying quality. Over time, MBS products became increasingly complex and opaque, but continued to be rated by external agencies as if they were very safe.\nInvestors who purchased MBS products mistakenly thought that they were buying a very low risk asset: even if some mortgage loans in the package were not repaid, it was assumed that most loans would continue to be repaid. These investors included large US banks, as well as foreign banks from Europe and other economies that sought higher returns than could be achieved in their local markets.\n2. Increased borrowing by banks and investors\nIn the lead up to the GFC, banks and other investors in the United States and abroad borrowed increasing amounts to expand their lending and purchase MBS products. Borrowing money to purchase an asset (known as an increase in leverage) magnifies potential profits but also magnifies potential losses.[1] As a result, when house prices began to fall, banks and investors incurred large losses because they had borrowed so much.\n\nAdditionally, banks and some investors increasingly borrowed money for very short periods, including overnight, to purchase assets that could not be sold quickly. Consequently, they became increasingly reliant on lenders \u2013 which included other banks \u2013 extending new loans as existing short-term loans were repaid.\n\n3. Regulation and policy errors\nRegulation of subprime lending and MBS products was too lax. In particular, there was insufficient regulation of the institutions that created and sold the complex and opaque MBS to investors. Not only were many individual borrowers provided with loans so large that they were unlikely to be able to repay them, but fraud was increasingly common \u2013 such as overstating a borrower's income and over-promising investors on the safety of the MBS products they were being sold.\n\nIn addition, as the crisis unfolded, many central banks and governments did not fully recognise the extent to which bad loans had been extended during the boom and the many ways in which mortgage losses were spreading through the financial system.\n\nHow the GFC Unfolded\nUS house prices fell, borrowers missed repayments\nThe catalysts for the GFC were falling US house prices and a rising number of borrowers unable to repay their loans. House prices in the United States peaked around mid 2006, coinciding with a rapidly rising supply of newly built houses in some areas. As house prices began to fall, the share of borrowers that failed to make their loan repayments began to rise. Loan repayments were particularly sensitive to house prices in the United States because the proportion of US households (both owner-occupiers and investors) with large debts had risen a lot during the boom and was higher than in other countries.\n\nStresses in the financial system\nStresses in the financial system first emerged clearly around mid 2007. Some lenders and investors began to incur large losses because many of the houses they repossessed after the borrowers missed repayments could only be sold at prices below the loan balance. Relatedly, investors became less willing to purchase MBS products and were actively trying to sell their holdings. As a result, MBS prices declined, which reduced the value of MBS and thus the net worth of MBS investors. In turn, investors who had purchased MBS with short-term loans found it much more difficult to roll over these loans, which further exacerbated MBS selling and declines in MBS prices.\n\nSpillovers to other countries\nAs noted above, foreign banks were active participants in the US housing market during the boom, including purchasing MBS (with short-term US dollar funding). US banks also had substantial operations in other countries. These interconnections provided a channel for the problems in the US housing market to spill over to financial systems and economies in other countries.\n\nFailure of financial firms, panic in financial markets\nFinancial stresses peaked following the failure of the US financial firm Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Together with the failure or near failure of a range of other financial firms around that time, this triggered a panic in financial markets globally. Investors began pulling their money out of banks and investment funds around the world as they did not know who might be next to fail and how exposed each institution was to subprime and other distressed loans. Consequently, financial markets became dysfunctional as everyone tried to sell at the same time and many institutions wanting new financing could not obtain it. Businesses also became much less willing to invest and households less willing to spend as confidence collapsed. As a result, the United States and some other economies fell into their deepest recessions since the Great Depression.\n\nPolicy Responses\nUntil September 2008, the main policy response to the crisis came from central banks that lowered interest rates to stimulate economic activity, which began to slow in late 2007. However, the policy response ramped up following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the downturn in global growth.\n\nLower interest rates\nCentral banks lowered interest rates rapidly to very low levels (often near zero); lent large amounts of money to banks and other institutions with good assets that could not borrow in financial markets; and purchased a substantial amount of financial securities to support dysfunctional markets and to stimulate economic activity once policy interest rates were near zero (known as \u2018quantitative easing\u2019).\n\nIncreased government spending\nGovernments increased their spending to stimulate demand and support employment throughout the economy; guaranteed deposits and bank bonds to shore up confidence in financial firms; and purchased ownership stakes in some banks and other financial firms to prevent bankruptcies that could have exacerbated the panic in financial markets.\n\nAlthough the global economy experienced its sharpest slowdown since the Great Depression, the policy response prevented a global depression. Nevertheless, millions of people lost their jobs, their homes and large amounts of their wealth. Many economies also recovered much more slowly from the GFC than previous recessions that were not associated with financial crises. For example, the US unemployment rate only returned to pre-crisis levels in 2016, about nine years after the onset of the crisis.\n\nStronger oversight of financial firms\nIn response to the crisis, regulators strengthened their oversight of banks and other financial institutions. Among many new global regulations, banks must now assess more closely the risk of the loans they are providing and use more resilient funding sources. For example, banks must now operate with lower leverage and can\u2019t use as many short-term loans to fund the loans that they make to their customers. Regulators are also more vigilant about the ways in which risks can spread throughout the financial system, and require actions to prevent the spreading of risks.", "label_value": 0.25, "index": 10530}, {"text": "The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) was a period of financial stress that started in mid 2007 and lasted until early 2009.

The US Federal Reserve had reduced interest rates following the 2001 Dotcom bubble burst, which encouraged banks to lend money not just to prime (safe) individuals, but also to sub-prime (risky) individuals, to invest in the housing market. Eventually, the number of sub-prime loans far outnumbered the prime loans, but banks managed to put lipstick on a pig by bundling the subprime mortgage backed securities with prime mortgage backed securities. This all came to a head in 2008 when the US Housing market crashed. Subprime borrowers mass defaulted on their debts, and the financial crisis went international when it was discovered that similar housing bubbles were building in other countries, like the UK, Spain, and Ireland.\n\nThe after effects of the 2008 global financial crisis were most present in the USA. The average net worth of a family decreased by about 26% (adjusted for inflation), and the unemployment rate was 10% in 2010. Some of the banks involved with the sub-prime mortgage lending ended up being bailed out by the government, which led to the \"Occupy Wall Street\" protests in 2011. Industrialized countries around the world saw decreases in fertility, and the public debt of these countries increased dramatically.

Bush and Barack Obama signed into law several legislative measures to counter its effects and prevent a similar crisis in the future. Among these the most influential measure was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which aimed to increase regulation of the financial sector, and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with the stated goal of protecting consumers from abusive financial practices. Dodd-Frank also expanded the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, giving whistleblowers further incentives and protections to report improper behavior in banks and other financial institutions.\n\nThe effectiveness of these measures in preventing another financial crisis is a matter of ongoing debate among experts. The Dodd-Frank Act commanded the Federal Reserve to closely oversee large banks, financial institutions, and insurance companies in the United States. Annual stress tests make sure that these companies are ready to handle future financial downturns and crises. It could be argued that overall this made the system more stable and resilient. Also the financial incentives under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act make the reporting of improper behavior easier and shady company secrets harder to keep.\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that the complexity of the financial system and the constant evolution of financial products have made it difficult for regulators to keep up and fully mitigate risks.

When the housing market eventually collapsed, many of these borrowers were unable to repay their loans, leading to a wave of foreclosures.\n\nLack of regulation: The lack of proper regulation of the financial sector contributed to the crisis. Investment banks were able to take on excessive risk and leverage, which made the financial system vulnerable to collapse.\n\nSecuritization: The practice of pooling and repackaging mortgages into securities, known as securitization, made it difficult to determine the true value of these securities, leading to a lack of trust in the financial system.\n\nInterconnectedness: The global financial system is highly interconnected, and the crisis in the US housing market quickly spread to other parts of the world through the global network of banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 have been far-reaching and have affected economies worldwide:\n\nEconomic downturn: The crisis led to a sharp decrease in economic activity, leading to widespread unemployment and lower GDP growth in many countries.\n\nBanking crisis: Many banks and financial institutions faced bankruptcy, leading to government bailouts and a loss of confidence in the financial sector.\n\nIncreased government debt: Governments around the world had to step in to stabilize their economies, leading to increased government debt in many countries.\n\nReduced global trade: The crisis led to a decrease in international trade, as countries became more protectionist and reduced their imports and exports.\n\nIncreased poverty: The crisis led to increased poverty, as many people lost their jobs and homes.\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 has had a profound impact on the world economy and has led to significant changes in the regulation of the financial sector. It has also served as a reminder of the importance of proper regulation and the dangers of excessive risk-taking in the financial sector.

They are particularly important in fighting viruses, fungi, and cancer cells. B cells, on the other hand, produce antibodies, which are proteins that recognize and neutralize pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Antibodies can also activate other immune cells to help destroy pathogens.\n\n- Antigen recognition: T cells recognize and bind to small fragments of proteins, called antigens, that are presented to them by other cells, while B cells recognize and bind to antigens directly. B cells can produce antibodies that recognize and bind to specific antigens, leading to their destruction.\n\n- Memory: Both T and B cells can form memory cells that allow the immune system to recognize and respond more quickly to a pathogen if it is encountered again in the future. T cells primarily form memory cells that recognize antigens presented to them by infected cells, while B cells primarily form memory cells that produce antibodies specific to a particular antigen.\n\nIn summary, T cells and B cells have different functions in the immune system, but they work together to fight off infections and maintain a healthy immune response.", "label_value": 0.08333333333333333, "index": 10762}, {"text": "Can you tell me more about the types of antibodies that B lymphocytes produce and their function?", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 10763}, {"text": "Thanks, pal.

The initial immune response produces a general set of antibodies, and then the immune system undergoes affinity maturation to produce higher affinity antibodies that are more tailored to the pathogen.

There are several types of T cells, including helper T cells, which help to activate and coordinate other cells of the immune system, and cytotoxic T cells, which can directly kill infected or abnormal cells.\n\nAnother major difference between B and T cells is where they mature.

Gather and preprocess data: This is an important step as the quality and diversity of the data will directly impact the performance of the model. Preprocessing may involve cleaning the data, tokenizing text, and converting words to numerical representations.\n\n3.

Data augmentation can be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset and improve the robustness of the model.\n\n5.

Psychology is considered a human science because it deals specifically with the study of human behavior, thoughts and experiences.\n\nPsychologists use various methods to study human behavior and mental processes, including observations, surveys, experiments, and brain imaging. This allows them to gather data and develop theories about how the mind and behavior work. They also use a variety of therapeutic techniques to help people with mental and emotional problems. While some psychologists work in the field of mental health where they assess, diagnose, and treat psychological conditions, others devote their time to researching psychological topics in order to add to our understanding of how people think and act. Still, other professionals investigate specific real-world problems and come up with solitions to resolve these issues. Over all, psychologists have a wide variety of work and applications to their science.\n\nOne of the key features of psychology as a science is that it relies on empirical evidence. This means that psychologists base their findings on empirical data obtained through scientific methods, such as experiments and observations, rather than just personal opinions or beliefs. This helps to ensure that the findings are accurate, reliable and valid.\n\nIn terms of the safety of its findings, psychology has established strict ethical guidelines to protect the well-being of research participants. For example, researchers must obtain informed consent from participants and protect their confidentiality. In addition, research involving human subjects must be approved by an institutional review board to ensure that it is ethical and safe.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that like all sciences, psychology is a constantly evolving field and new research may challenge or modify previous findings. Additionally, not all theories or therapeutic techniques are supported by scientific evidence, and some may even be harmful. As such, it is important to be critical of the information and advice provided by psychologists and to seek out research-supported approaches.\n\nIn conclusion, psychology is a human science that aims to understand, explain and predict human behavior and mental processes. It relies on empirical evidence obtained through scientific methods and is guided by ethical principles to ensure the safety of research participants. However, it is important to remain critical of the findings and approach psychology with an open mind, as new research may challenge or modify previous understandings.", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 10853}, {"text": "Why wouldn't you consider poignancy to be the opposite of nostalgia?", "label_value": 0.0625, "index": 10854}, {"text": "So they aren't opposites because nostalgia refers specifically to a time in the past/ past event whereas poignancy could refer to an event that has just happened or an event in the past?", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 10858}, {"text": "What would you consider to be the opposite of nostalgia?", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 10859}, {"text": "Does this mean that poignancy contains nostalgia inside of it?", "label_value": 0.08333333333333333, "index": 10861}, {"text": "Although both nostalgia and poignancy may evoke the general feeling of reminiscence, poignancy can also describe something in the present that causes one to feel regretful or sad.

To do so, add the following line inside your <head> </head> tags inside your index.html file.\n```\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n```\n\n- every CSS field should have either a tag, and ID or a class, followed by brackets.

You can follow this example, but you should definitely check CSS documentation sites, such as W3Schools.com.\n\nThis code will change the style of your HTML <p> tags with the following properties: color (text color) and background-color (the color of the background of the <p> HTML tag).\n```\np {\n    color: green;\n    background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nIn HTML, you can use IDs and Classes to better identify parts of your code. You can use classes and IDs to group together many tags and style them all at once!\nIn the following example, we will be styling all items with the class=\"element\" HTML attribute.\n\nRegular HTML tags are accessed by simply putting their name. \nHTML classes are accessed from CSS by using a dot (.) in front of the name. \nHTML IDs are accessed from css by using a hashtag (#) in fron of the name.\n\nHere is an example showing all three CSS tags:\n```\n/* Regular HTML tag, can be anything in HTML.

Here's a breakdown of each part of the Sieve of Eratosthenes implementation in Python:\n\ndef sieve(n: int) -> list[int]:\n\nThis is a function definition that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime numbers up to (excluding) n.\n\n    primes = [True] * n\n\nThis creates a list of n elements, where each element is initially set to True.

The outer loop iterates over all numbers from 2 up to the square root of n. The inner loop then iterates over all multiples of the current number i and marks them as non-prime by setting their corresponding value in the primes list to False.\n\nFor example, if i is 2, then all even numbers (except 2 itself) are marked as non-prime. If i is 3, then all multiples of 3 (except 3 itself) are marked as non-prime. This process continues until all numbers up to n have been checked.\n\n    # Return all indices marked as primes (except for 1, which is a special case)\n    return [i for i in range(2, n) if primes[i]]\n\nFinally, this line returns a list of all indices (i.e., numbers) that are still marked as prime in the primes list. The range(2, n) excludes the number 1, which is a special case that is not considered prime. The list comprehension only includes numbers whose corresponding value in the primes list is still True, indicating that they are prime.\n\nOverall, this implementation is a simple and efficient way to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 11093}, {"text": "Can you please explain how the code works?

All other integers in `numbers` that have it as a factor are removed as candidate primes.\n```python\n    prime = numbers.pop(0)\n    primes.append(prime)\n    numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % prime != 0]\n```\n\nAfter all numbers have been evaluated, the list of generated primes is returned.", "label_value": 0.08333333333333333, "index": 11097}, {"text": "```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(n):\n  numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))  # generate a list from 2 to n\n  primes = []                      # initiate a currently empty list of prime numbers\n  while numbers:                   # as long as there are numbers in the first list\n    prime = numbers.pop(0)         # take the currently first number in the list\n    primes.append(prime)           # add it to the list of primes\n    numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % prime != 0]  # from the list of numbers, remove those divisible by that prime\n  return primes  # once the initial list of numbers is exhausted, return the list of all found primes\n```\n\n- The code first generates all the natural numbers from 2 to n, as well as an empty list for storing found primes.\nNote: `range()` in python does not include the top value. For instance, `range(3)` would generate the numbers \"0, 1, 2\" and `range(2,3)` would only generate the number 2.\nTo properly find all primes occurring in the positive numbers up to and including n, it is therefore necessary to add 1 to the top argument. This is why the code reads `range(2, n + 1)` rather than `range(2, n)`.\n\n- As 2 is the smallest prime number, the first number in the list of `numbers` is already prime, so the sieve of Eratosthenes takes out that number using `numbers.pop(0)` (the list `numbers`now goes from 3 to n) and puts it into the list of primes.\nNote: The argument in `pop()` specifies which element of a list is taken out. By default, `pop()` takes out the final element of the list. `pop(0)` makes sure the first element is taken instead.\n\n- The code then uses a list comprehension to filter the list of numbers against that first prime number. This can be a bit complex to read, but is compact notation:\n`num for num in numbers if num % prime != 0` is roughly equivalent to (but more efficient than):\n\n```python\nnew_numbers = []                # construct a new list of numbers\nfor num in numbers:             # for each number in numbers,\n    if num % prime != 0:        # if the prime does NOT divide that number,\n        new_numbers.append(num) # add the number to the list of new numbers\nnumbers = new_numbers           # then use the new list in place of the old list\n```\n`%` here denotes the modulo function which returns the rest of a division. For instance, 7/3 = 2 with 1 rest, so 7 % 3 would be 1.\nIf the outcome is 0 (for instance 6/3 = 2 with 0 rest, so 6 % 3 is 0), it means the right argument cleanly divides the left argument.\nSince in the above code, the right argument here would initially be 2, this list comprehension filters out all numbers divisible by 2 such as 4, 6, 8, ...\nThe list `numbers` now contains no more numbers divisible by 2, and the first number in the list must be the next prime number. In this case, that would be 3.\n\n- From here, the loop is finished and the code returns to the initial line of the loop: `while numbers:`\n\n- If the list `numbers` is now exhausted, the loop is escaped and the list of found primes is found. Otherwise, the loop starts over with the now filtered and necessarily smaller list `numbers`.\n\nThe while loop is guaranteed to escape eventually, as the list `numbers` is finite, and at the very least one element is removed from that list every step using `pop()`, and so for positive integers as input `n`, it will correctly find all prime numbers up to the specified size, stored in a list sorted from the smallest (2) to the largest prime in the given range..\nFor integers smaller than 2, it will just return the empty list `[]`.\nNote: for non-integer values, `sieve_of_eratosthenes` will throw a TypeError as `range(2, n + 1)` expects `n` to be an integer.", "label_value": 0.08333333333333333, "index": 11098}, {"text": "The fastest public transport option is to take the red line subway.

It is one of the most prominent schools of thought in ancient Greece and has had a lasting impact on Western culture and philosophy.\n\nEpicureanism is centered around the pursuit of pleasure and peace of mind, or \"ataraxia.\" According to Epicurus, the highest good is pleasure, and the ultimate goal of life is to achieve a state of contentment and happiness. This pleasure is not to be understood as sensual or hedonistic pleasure, but rather as peace of mind and absence of physical and mental pain.\n\nEpicurus also believed in the importance of living a simple and moderate life, free from the excesses of luxury and extravagance. He argued that excessive desires and material possessions can only lead to anxiety, frustration, and unhappiness. Instead, he encouraged his followers to seek happiness through friendship, philosophical inquiry, and an appreciation of the simple pleasures of life.\n\nOne of the key aspects of Epicureanism is its materialist view of the world. Epicurus believed that everything in the universe is composed of atoms and that knowledge of the natural world can be achieved through observation and reason. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, instead believing that death is a state of non-existence, and that the fear of death is therefore irrational and unnecessary.\n\nAnother central feature of Epicureanism is its stance on ethics and morality. Epicurus believed that ethics should be based on the pursuit of pleasure and avoiding pain. He held that the ultimate measure of right and wrong was whether an action or choice was likely to bring happiness or sadness, and that moral rules serve as guidelines for how to live a contented and pleasurable life.\n\nWhile Epicureanism was highly influential in ancient Greece, it fell out of favor in the centuries that followed. However, its ideas have been rediscovered and reinterpreted by later philosophers, including Lucretius and the Romans, and it remains an important and relevant philosophy to this day.\n\nIn conclusion, Epicureanism is a philosophy of life that is centered around the pursuit of pleasure and peace of mind, and that emphasizes living a simple and moderate life, materialism, and ethical hedonism. Its enduring legacy has made it an important and influential philosophy across the ages, and its ideas continue to appeal to people searching for happiness and meaning in life.", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 11138}, {"text": "Here are some sources for the article, referenced in the Harvard referencing method:\n\nRussell, B.

The EULA allows developers to use the engine for free as long as they meet certain revenue thresholds. For example, developers can use the engine for free if their gross revenue from the product is less than $1 million per year. This makes it easier for indie developers to get started with Unreal Engine without having to pay upfront licensing fees.\n\nIn addition, Epic Games has created various programs to support indie developers using Unreal Engine, such as the Unreal Dev Grants program, which provides funding to developers working on innovative projects, and the Unreal Marketplace, which allows developers to sell their assets and content to other developers.\n\nFurthermore, Unreal Engine's pricing model is generally considered more favorable to indie developers compared to other game engines. Unlike some other engines, Unreal Engine does not charge developers a percentage of their revenue as a licensing fee. Instead, they charge a flat 5% royalty fee on gross revenue after the first $1 million, which can be more cost-effective for indie developers.\n\nOverall, Unreal Engine's approach to indie projects is generally considered to be more permissive and supportive compared to other game engines.

Around December 1989, the development of Python started, where Guido van Rossum became the self-proclaimed \"benevolent dictator for life\" until 2018. In 1994 Python reached its first full Version, 1.0. At this time, Python was never a very popular language and outclassed by the popular scripting language Perl. \nWith Version 2.0, which was released in October 2000, Python became a popular alternative scripting languge. Even though Python offered full object-oriented features, it still had no chance against other popular object oriented languages, such as Java. Because python offered a way to connect multiple langugaes through Python, many developeres used it next to their primary programming language.\nA big shift in mindset happend in 2007 with the launch of Dropox. As Dropox was written entirely in Python, a lot more people took Python more serious. \nIn 2008 Python 3.0 was realesed, where they \"reduce feature duplication by removing old ways of doing things\", which further increased the maintainability and readability of python code. After this time many very popular libraries, such as NumPy were released, offering high performance packages for most calculations, alowing Python to compete with other scripting languages such as R and Matlab.\nAs Python combines easy to read code with other high performance languges, it allowed developement of even more high performant libraries like Pytorch, Tensorflow, scipy. These libraries further increasing the performance of code, while staying readable and easy to use.\n\nIn conclusion, Python became popular for its readability and its connection with other languages. As Thomas Hatch once said \"Python is great for many things, but the best part is its ability to play nice with many languages\". Because many high performant data science libraries are written for Python, it is likely that the popularity will increase even further.", "label_value": 0.25, "index": 11560}, {"text": "Could you add a section about Python syntax? specifically on why some people like or dislike it.", "label_value": 0.25, "index": 11561}, {"text": "Python is an interpreted multi-purpose language created by Van Rossum in the late 1980's. Van Rossum was a Dutch programmer who worked at the National Research Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. He started working on the Python programming language as a hobby and fun project to help him with his work on the ABC language, which was used to teach programming to peoples.\n\nIn his statement about the creation of Python, Van Rossum said: \"I was looking for a 'hobby' programming project to keep me busy around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer and not much else on hand. I decided to write an interpreter for a new scripting language that I had recently thought: For an ABC scion who appeals to Unix/C hackers I chose Python as the project's working name , being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)[1].\n\nMy first version of Python was released on February 20, 1991, and since then it has become one of the most popular programming languages \u200b\u200bin the world. The ease of use and readability of the code are the main reasons why Python has gained succes in the programming industry. It is often referred to as a \"batteries included\" language, meaning that it has many built-in libraries and modules which allow developers to build complex applications without having to write everything from scratch.\n\nPython is used in many different types of programns such as games, web development, data analysis, machine learning etc. It has a very large and active user community that participates in the development of the language and its libraries. This makes Python a very versatile and dynamic programming language that is well suited for a wide variety of tasks.\n\nIn short, Guido van Rossum created Python in the late 1980s as a hobby project to help him with his work on the ABC language.

For example, platforms with high amounts of bots, vocal minorities that act as lynch mobs, or that have a history of spreading false information can decrease the trustworthiness of information. Additionally, information on social media platforms such as Twitter or Reddit can be particularly susceptible to misinformation, as users are often more concerned with being entertaining or getting attention than with presenting accurate information.\n\nOn the other hand, platforms such as Quora, that have many self-proclaimed \"experts\" can be a valuable resource for verifying information. However, it's important to keep in mind that not all \"experts\" are truly knowledgeable or impartial, and that information on these platforms can still be influenced by personal biases, commercial interests, or other factors.\n\nWhen evaluating scientific papers, it's important to consider the following:\n\n1. The methodology: Does the study use appropriate research methods, and is the sample size sufficient to support the conclusions?\n\n2. The funding: Who funded the study, and do they have a vested interest in the results?\n\n3. The peer review process: Has the study been peer reviewed, and what were the findings of the review?\n\n4. The publication venue: Is the publication venue reputable, and is it a reputable source of information for the topic at hand?\n\n5. The author's credentials: What is the author's background, and do they have expertise in the area they are writing about?\n\nThese are just some of the key points to look for when evaluating scientific papers, and it's important to approach each paper with a critical and skeptical eye, especially if the findings are unexpected or contrary to established scientific knowledge.", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 11969}, {"text": "Alright, you've highlighted the issues with certain online sources such as Reddit and Twitter, and discussed the issues I raised in regards to them.

Look for established news organizations, government agencies, and non-partisan organizations for reliable information.\n\n- Check for multiple sources: Look for multiple sources that report on the same event to see if there is consistency in the information. If multiple sources are reporting different information, it may indicate that one of the sources is spreading false information.\n\n- Check the date information is shared: Information can become outdated or inaccurate over time. Old information can be outdated, and therefore it may not be reliable anymore.\n\n- Look for supporting evidence: Look for supporting evidence, such as statistics, quotes, or images. If the information cannot be supported by any other instance, it may be false.\n\n- Check the tone of the message and it's content: Be aware of articles or posts that have a sensational or emotional tone. This type of content is often used to spread false information and propaganda or it may be produced in a anger or exitement.\n\n- Consider the platform and user base: The platform and user base can impact the trustworthiness of information.

This is a difficult problem, and will likely need trusted human researchers to manually look into the sources of claims, their historical reliability, and any underlying interests and incentives those sources have, in order to verify that information. A good summary of a repeatable process for evaluating unfamiliar sources could be to:\n\n - Identify however many sources make a similar claim to the one you are verifying, and try to identify any primary sources among them.\n - Look into the history of these primary sources, have they made any claims that you can independently verify? If not, is that due to the difficulty of verifying the claim, or is it due to the unverifiability of the claim? \n - Look into the connections and affiliations of these sources, do they have an explicit incentive to make their claims? If they do, are there any counterclaims elsewhere that can also be verified? \n\nHowever, since in most real world examples of propaganda and misinformation, false and unverified information is only used for shock value at the \"entry\" level of a disinformation pipeline, and the ultimate goal is usually to create a more permanent seperation between the ingroup and the outgroup, the quality of those quantifications can help our classifications, but may not be critical for them. Instead, we can classify most misinformation and disinformation solely based on one or two verified points of fact and then classify clusters of users that actively and reliably behave negatively towards verified information as sources of misinformation (modified or false information,) or propaganda (not necessarily modified information, but a filtering of reality to support a specific position or viewpoint over the whole truth). \n\nThere are likely gaps in this scheme that could lead to it being gamed or manipulated to censor or harm benign or dissident minority activities, so it is important to seek the aid of misinformation or harm reduction experts before you use the outputs of this scheme to enact any action or create any policy.", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 11977}, {"text": "This is a complex issue as the world, and its events often have many competing interpretations.

Some common layer types include:\n\nInput Layer: This is the first layer in a neural network that receives input data. It usually does not perform any transformations on the data but is responsible for representing the input in a format that can be processed by subsequent layers.\nDense Layer (Fully Connected Layer): This type of layer connects every neuron in the layer to every neuron in the preceding and following layers. It performs a linear transformation on the input data, followed by an activation function.\nConvolutional Layer: This layer is primarily used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for processing images and other grid-like data. It applies a set of filters to the input data to detect local patterns or features.\nPooling Layer: Often used in conjunction with convolutional layers, pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the input data by applying a downsampling operation like max-pooling or average-pooling.\nRecurrent Layer: This type of layer is used in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to process sequences of data with temporal dependencies. Examples include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs).\nNormalization Layer: These layers help to normalize input data or intermediate activations, improving the stability and convergence of the training process. Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization are popular examples.\nDropout Layer: Dropout layers are used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. During training, they randomly deactivate a proportion of neurons in the layer, forcing the model to learn redundant representations.\nEmbedding Layer: This layer is used to convert categorical variables or discrete tokens, like words in natural language processing, into continuous vectors that can be processed by the neural network.\nAttention Layer: Often used in Transformer models, attention layers enable the network to selectively focus on different parts of the input data by computing a weighted sum of input features.\nResidual Layer: Also known as skip connections or shortcut connections, residual layers allow the input to bypass one or more layers, enabling the network to learn identity functions and improving gradient flow during backpropagation.\nThese are some of the common layer types found in neural networks.

The most common activation functions include the sigmoid function, the hyperbolic tangent function, and the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function.

Use common best practices in your explanations.", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 12294}, {"text": "In a neural network, a hidden layer is a layer of neurons that is situated between the input and output layers. The neurons in the hidden layer perform complex computations on the input data and pass the results to the output layer. The term \"hidden\" refers to the fact that the internal workings of the layer are not visible to the outside world.\n\nA neural network with multiple hidden layers is called a deep neural network. Deep neural networks are particularly effective at learning complex patterns in data and are widely used in various applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n\nHere are some best practices for using and optimizing hidden layers in a neural network:\n\nChoose the right number of hidden layers: Generally, a single hidden layer is sufficient for most tasks, but for more complex problems, multiple hidden layers may be necessary. However, adding too many hidden layers can lead to overfitting, so it's important to strike a balance between model complexity and generalization.\n\nChoose the right number of neurons: The number of neurons in the hidden layer(s) also affects the performance of the neural network. Too few neurons may not capture all the relevant features of the data, while too many neurons can lead to overfitting. A common rule of thumb is to choose a number of neurons that is somewhere between the number of input and output neurons.\n\nUse appropriate activation functions: The choice of activation function for the neurons in the hidden layer(s) can have a significant impact on the performance of the neural network. Common choices include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh functions, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nRegularize the network: Regularization techniques, such as dropout and L1/L2 regularization, can help prevent overfitting in deep neural networks by reducing the complexity of the model.\n\nOptimize the network: There are various techniques for optimizing the neural network's parameters, such as stochastic gradient descent and its variants, which update the weights of the neurons based on the error between the predicted output and the actual output. Other techniques, such as batch normalization and weight initialization, can also improve the performance of the network.\n\nOverall, hidden layers are a crucial component of deep neural networks and can greatly enhance the model's ability to learn complex patterns in data. By following best practices and experimenting with different configurations, you can optimize the performance of your neural network and achieve better results in your machine learning tasks.", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 12295}, {"text": "To draw a neural network architecture in Python, you can use the Matplotlib library.

It may seem frustrating and hopeless at the moment, however if you stop applying yourself it is unlikely that any internship can be acquired by idleness.\n\nIf you believe your professor to be unnecessarily abrasive and verbally abusive attempt to arrange a meeting with them during their office hours and explain how you feel to them. Perhaps they do not realize they are hurting you and it is best to explain the situation to them from your perspective. However, you may need to meet with your college dean to explain the professor's abusive behavior should they be intently or continue to be abusive to you.\n\nWhile I cannot condone rude behavior to others and the breaking of discord server rules, perhaps you can reach out to the moderators of the discord servers you were banned from and appeal the decision of your ban with moderators themselves and attempt to apologize for your previous behavior. \n\nThat is unfortunate, However I do not know the full situation of your living condition so I cannot offer a specific piece of advice for your situation. Perhaps you should try speaking to your mother about it. However, if she is unable to afford better food for you perhaps you could take on a job to buy food for yourself. Along with buying food due you should be able to buy new clothes if you lack them, though I would suggest refraining from extraneous spending like your classmates might partake in.\n\nAs for your grades I suggest speaking with the professors and asking for extra credit, or any other assignment you can do to raise your grade. Though If any recovery is impossible perhaps you should speak to your counselor about dropping the class and retaking it the next semester.\n\nWith enough time and practice anyone can learn anything, continue to practice with your scooter and you should be able to ride it in no time.\n\nAgain, I must implore you to seek mental help from your family that is available to you, medical professionals, and your college consulars. They are there to help you.\n\nBeing threatened by your classmates is a serious situation. If you can attempt to get them on an audio recording. However regardless of that you should report them to a college staff member, threats should not be taken lightly, and it is best to report them to the local authorities should they attempt any form of violence or bullying.\n\nThat is a tough situation, as I suggested before attempt to find a job, and apply for any social welfare that you apply for to improve your living situation.\n\nYour brother not talking to you is unfortunate as well, however I cannot offer any specific advice on what to do with your brother. Try to reach out to them if you can even if he ignores you, attempt to discover why he refuses to speak with you. But perhaps he just does not wish to contact you for other personal reasons in which case there isn't much you can do.\n\nIt is a terrible situation you find yourself in however with enough work and effort you can ultimately reverse it into a more favorable situation, but if all else fails speak to a therapist or medical professional to help you with your suicidal thoughts, you are not alone in this.", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 12316}, {"text": "I don't think you should die.

It was in his blood, this desire to see things hitherto unknown. His father, a wise adventurer himself, had already charted so much of the world. What, Yon wondered, was there left to find?\n\nHis answer was above him. Every infant reaches up to the heavens to pluck at the stars, and finds that they are too far away. The vault of the sky, the firmament, would be his destination. He would personally investigate it, touch it, and be remembered for all time for it.\n\nUnlike the journeys of his father, this would require inventors and resources. His father, Hither, had merely needed a wooden ship, contemporary for his era. Advancing upwards meant harnessing new methods and technology. He spoke to many scholars on what could be done. The handful of people who believed what Yon could do was possible agreed there was only one source of energy that could lift Yon that high into the sky: the terrible and fiery might of the volcano Hekla. To properly catch its fire, it was said, would require uncountable animal hides to catch the hot air as it radiated out of that mountaintop furnace. Only then, it was determined, could Yon lift himself up to the firmament.\n\nYon knew that this effort would take a large amount of resources, and thus began planning for the long term. Since he was brought up by a legendary sailor, he learned from his father of what fabulous places dotted the world. Diligently, Yon set himself out to become a wealthy merchant. He gathered hides from the far north, traded spices from east and west, fruit from the south. People loved these faraway goods that improved their lives, and Yon was an honest dealer. These pelts, especially, were stored as they would be useful for the journey directly as part of the balloon. \n\nOn his travels, Yon met skilled engineers who could build a great trebuchet to cast the woven hides across Hekla's crater, and the basket that he would ride in. He found lumber from a great tree, sturdy and massive enough to make such a catapult. After several years, he finally had everything he needed to begin his journey.\n\nAll the scholars and craftsmen stood at the base of the trebuchet, which, when the taut rope was cut, would cast the great pelt over the fiery volcano, and in turn lift Yon up to the firmament. Yon was in a woven basket, with many ropes also tied to the great mass of hides that would form this first hot air balloon. Hither also watched, proud of his son's hard work but worried if this great project would work out. Yon was also nervous, divided on whether he should continue this project or not, but his heart still called him upwards.\n\nHither himself cut the rope, at Yon's request. The rope cracked, dropping the counterweight and sending the hides in a great arc over the volcano. They sank over the crater, and then, slowly, began to billow up again. Yon's basket began to slide along the ground, slowly and then faster, bumping and skipping along the ground towards Hekla. The balloon was rising! Yon was ecstatic and trying to keep control of his craft, while the rest of his team cheered. Yon's basket was now more airborne than not, and he was well on his way to the firmament. \n\nHowever, now this journey was Yon's alone to complete. As the perils of the ground were less of an issue, his friends and teammates appeared smaller and smaller as he looked back. He was getting very far away. After only a few minutes he could see them as only dots. The trebuchet became harder to see as well. Soon the air smelled less like Hekla's sulfur than before, although it was still quite hot. Up and up he went. Yon knew that he would get very high up, but did not know that he would feel so dizzy looking down on the landscape from so high up.\n\nThe first new thing that Yon learned was that higher altitudes meant that the air grew colder. Soon he was tucked up in the spare pelt he had brought for this, just in case. The sky got darker and darker, soon becoming as black as night. He wondered if the air would get even colder as he rose, and if it would be dangerous for him. Luckily, he knew he was getting close to his destination.\n\nThe stars appeared to be getting larger, as great circles of light, he could see now. The balloon seemed to drift along at a stable pace now. He had finally reached the firmament, but the gravity of the situation now was apparent to him, even as his feet felt a little lighter. Would he manage to get a sample of this mysterious substance at the top of the sky? Would he be able to get down safely?

The balloon swayed gently in the wind, and he could feel the heat from the flame as it roared to life, filling the massive balloon with hot air.\n\nSlowly but surely, the balloon began to rise into the air, and Yon felt his heart race with excitement. He looked down at the world below, and saw the familiar landscapes and communities of his homeland slowly shrinking away into the distance.\n\nAs he soared higher and higher, Yon encountered all manner of strange and wondrous sights. He saw massive flocks of birds flying below him, and towering mountains that reached up to the clouds.

Storms and high winds threatened to tear his balloon apart, and he had to be constantly vigilant to avoid crashing into mountains or other obstacles.\n\nBut through it all, Yon remained steadfast and determined, driven by his desire to explore and discover the wonders of the world.

Set notation is often denoted using braces: { }, which contain the elements of the set separated by commas. For example, the set of natural numbers less than 5 can be written as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n2. Sometimes, we use ellipses to represent a pattern or sequence of elements. For example, the set of even natural numbers can be written as {2, 4, 6, ...}.\n\n3. If an element is in a set, we use the symbol \"\u2208\" to show that it belongs to that set. For example, 3 \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n4. If an element is not in a set, we use the symbol \"\u2209\" to show that it does not belong to that set. For example, 5 \u2209 {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n5. We can use set-builder notation to define a set by specifying a property that its elements share. For example, the set of even numbers can be written as {x : x is an integer and x is even}.\n\n6.

For example, the set of even numbers could be written as {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}.\n\nElement notation: The elements of a set are listed within the set brackets, separated by commas. For example, the set of primary colors could be written as {red, blue, yellow}.\n\nSet membership symbol: The symbol \u2208 is used to indicate that an element belongs to a set. For example, to say that the number 3 is an element of the set of odd numbers, we write 3 \u2208 {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}.\n\nSet cardinality: The cardinality of a set is the number of elements it contains. The symbol | | is used to denote cardinality. For example, the cardinality of the set {1, 2, 3} is written as |{1, 2, 3}| = 3.\n\nSet operations: There are several set operations, including union, intersection, and complement.

Here's how the parry mechanic works in Dark Souls 1 and some tips on how to use it effectively against Gwyn:\n\n1. To parry, you need to use a parry tool, such as a small shield or a parrying dagger. When an enemy attacks you, press the parry button (usually the left trigger on a controller) just before the attack lands.\n\n2. If you time your parry correctly, your character will perform a parry animation, which will deflect the enemy's attack and leave them vulnerable to a critical hit.\n\n3. To perform a critical hit, immediately press the attack button after a successful parry. This will trigger a riposte animation, which deals a large amount of damage to the enemy.\n\n4. Parrying requires precise timing, so it may take some practice to get the timing down. It's important to watch the enemy closely and learn their attack patterns so you can anticipate when to parry.\n\n5. Against Gwyn specifically, he has a few attacks that are particularly easy to parry, such as his jumping attack and his overhead swing. Watch for these attacks and try to parry them to open him up for a critical hit.\n\n6. It's also important to note that Gwyn has a grab attack that cannot be parried, so be careful not to accidentally mistime your parry and leave yourself open to this attack.\n\n7. Finally, make sure you have a high stability shield with good fire resistance equipped, as Gwyn deals fire damage with his attacks.\n\nOverall, mastering the parry mechanic can make the Gwyn fight much easier, but it requires practice and precision. Watch for his attacks, learn his patterns, and don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries to get the timing down. Good luck!", "label_value": 0.125, "index": 12456}, {"text": "Thank You.

To perform a parry, you need to time your shield bash so that it connects with the enemy's attack during a specific window of vulnerability. If you time it correctly, you will hear a distinct sound and see the enemy stagger, indicating that you have successfully parried them.\n\nTo effectively use parrying to defeat Gwyn, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\nTiming is everything: Gwyn is a fast and aggressive boss, so you need to time your parries perfectly to deflect his attacks. Watch his movements carefully and look for patterns in his attacks to anticipate when to parry.\n\nUse a parry-friendly shield: Not all shields are created equal when it comes to parrying. Look for shields with good stability and a fast parry animation, such as the Target Shield or the Buckler.\n\nPractice makes perfect: Parrying takes practice and patience, so don't get discouraged if you don't succeed right away. Spend some time practicing on weaker enemies to get a feel for the timing and animation of the parry.\n\nUse ripostes for maximum damage: When you successfully parry Gwyn, you'll have a short window of time to perform a riposte by pressing the light attack button. Ripostes do massive damage, so use them whenever possible to take chunks off of Gwyn's health bar.\n\nDon't get greedy: Gwyn is a tough opponent, so don't get greedy with your parries and ripostes. Focus on timing your parries and taking advantage of the riposte window when it's available, but don't overextend and leave yourself vulnerable to counterattacks.\n\nBy using these tips and practicing your parrying skills, you should be able to effectively use parrying to defeat Gwyn and complete Dark Souls 1.

Usually it incorporates the processing of information leading to successful outcomes in a specific environment or across a broader range of environments. There exist different aspects of intelligence, like the range of different information inputs, the ability to remember the past and adapt to past experiences, the complexity of the of the resulting behavior and the generalization capabilities across different inputs and environments. The Intelligent behavior can be observed in single individuals or in the interactions within a group of individuals, more like an emergent effect. Concerning the complexity and adaption capabilities of the observed intelligence behavior, the human species is held the most intelligent known life form, with human beings held as the most intelligent individuals.\nBecause of these many different forms, there are different tests concerning different aspects.\nFor example one can observe bacteria moving opposite to a gradient of a poisonous chemical, which proves this is information in their range of perceivable inputs. To measure the complexity of some intelligent behavior, standard complexity measures like the Kolmogorov complexity of a simulation thereof can be used, while a less rigorous measure is the number of words needed to describe the behavior. Among humans there are different IQ tests, often based on visual and language based information - which aim mostly at the generalization capabilities - perceiving regularities and differences among visual patterns, applying formal logic and other aspects.\nSince the invention of the computer, also artificially intelligent systems have been created. These systems have long surpassed human individuals in terms of information storage and are increasingly stepping up towards human capabilities in terms of adaptivity, complexity and generalization. Because humans are extra-ordinarily intelligent, they are an important baseline in artificial intelligence research. Alan Turing was the first to propose a test based on a human trying to classify a conversation partner as another human or an artificial agent, just interacting based on text in natural language.\nAs mentioned previously, the definition of intelligence also depends heavily on the environment. The \"No Free Lunch\" theorem by Wolpert and Macready suggests that generally intelligent behavior across all possible environments is impossible.

Chords are groups of notes played simultaneously, usually consisting of a root note and other notes from the same scale. Chord progressions create a sense of movement and tension in music, which can be resolved or left unresolved, depending on the desired effect.\n\nA scale, in music theory, is a sequence of notes arranged in ascending or descending order by pitch. Scales are the building blocks of both melodies and chord progressions. There are several types of scales, with the most common ones being the major scale and the minor scale. Each scale has a specific pattern of intervals (the distance between notes) that gives it a unique sound and character.\n\nWhen composing a melody, it's essential to know the scale you're working in, as it will determine the pool of notes you can use to create your melody. If you're also writing a chord progression, the chords will typically be built using the notes from the same scale. By using the notes of the chords in your melody, you can create a sense of harmony and coherence between the melody and the chord progression.\n\nTo get started with writing a melody, you can follow these steps:\n\nChoose a scale: Pick a scale to work with, such as the major or minor scale. The scale will determine the overall mood of your melody (e.g., happy, sad, or tense).\n\nDetermine the key: Select a key for your melody, which will be the starting note (or root) of your scale. The key determines the pitch center of your melody and can be changed to modulate the piece of music to create variation and interest.\n\nCreate a chord progression: Use the notes from your chosen scale to build chords and arrange them in a sequence that sounds pleasing and harmonically interesting. Common progressions include the I-IV-V-I and ii-V-I in major keys, and i-iv-V-i and i-VI-III-VII in minor keys.\n\nWrite your melody: Start experimenting with the notes from your chosen scale and the chords in your progression. Create a series of short phrases or motifs that can be combined, repeated, or varied to form a complete melody. Try to incorporate a mix of stepwise motion (moving between adjacent notes in the scale) and leaps (skipping notes) to create interest and variety.\n\nAdd rhythm: Incorporate rhythmic patterns and variations to give your melody a sense of movement and structure. Use a mix of short and long notes, syncopation, and rests to create a dynamic and engaging melody.\n\nBy following these steps and understanding the relationship between scales, chords, and melodies, you'll be well on your way to creating your own original compositions.", "label_value": 0.0625, "index": 12667}, {"text": "What is AGI and why it not possible yet?", "label_value": 0.5, "index": 12668}, {"text": "Chord progressions are a series of chords played in a specific order that form the harmonic foundation of a piece of music.

In music, scaling typically refers to the adjustment of notes in a melody or chord progression to create a different tonal effect. For example, a scale can be played in a higher or lower octave to create a different mood or feeling in a musical piece.

In each of these fields, the generative design process typically starts with the input of a set of design requirements and constraints, such as materials, budget, and functional requirements. The software then generates a large number of potential design solutions, taking into account the constraints and requirements.\n\nThe outputs of the generative design process are typically visualized in 3D or 2D graphics, allowing designers to quickly evaluate and compare many different design options.

Enhance Your Workspace\n\nA clean workspace means less visual and physical distraction from your goal. This doesn't mean making your workspace absent of decorations, this means making your workspace a place you want to work. Your productivity will go up a significant margin if you don't have much to fumble around with distracting objects or other assignments physically. Make your workspace your own.\n\n2. Plan a Time and Make a Habit\n\nSometimes you just need to designate a proper time to do your work. Most people operate well when they give themselves some form of assignment or time urgency to a victory or a goal. Reducing delays earns you bonus points, as long as the delays aren't more critical to your success or other goals.\n\n3. Try a Writing Prompt\n\nAs in all mental blocks or hurdles, writer's block means you haven't asked the right question (or number of questions) to get you an answer. Prompting yourself by asking relevant questions is an excellent way to guide yourself to meet your own or other's expectations. Sometimes dividing tasks into subtasks explicitly is efficient, or figuring out order of importance (chronologically, sociologically, etc.) amongst a chaos of relevant ideas.\n\n4. Accept flaws as they come\n\nYou are not perfect, and neither is anyone else; that includes your audience. Amongst complexity, making everything to a level of perfection requires a ton of work from zero. You do not need to use your entire brain and existence on every word, idea, thought, or sentence. You can come back to your ideas later to edit them if they can be said in a more logical or more efficient manner. Using mildly relevant ideas can sometimes make you question yourself to write more correct or more relevant ideas later on.\n\n5. Read more often\n\nThis trains your brain to outsource for inspiration. Some authors have already done so much work in the space of language, logic, and storytelling, that you yourself would benefit from exploring the hive mind of ideas that are in existing libraries. You don't need to come up with new ideas all the time, you can sometimes find inspiration in patterns that other authors use. English is a language of many different possibilities, and sometimes you can find efficiency and precision in the works of trained authors.\n\n6. Exercise\n\nPhysically moving your body around for 90 or more minutes of a day has been proven through theory and study to (generally) positively affect other areas of intelligence (although every minute of meaningful exercise seems to help). Physically exercising is what your body has been designed to do after hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Moving around moves your body fluids around which improves your immune system, reduces nerve inflammation, reduces risk of chronic disease, and so much more neurological benefits that haven't been yet fully explored.", "label_value": 0.08333333333333333, "index": 12723}, {"text": "Here are some habits that may help prevent writer's block:\n\n    Maintaining a consistent writing routine: Set aside a specific time each day to write, even if it's just for a short period of time. This can help establish a habit and make it easier to get into the flow of writing.\n\n    Keeping a journal or idea file: Jot down any ideas, thoughts, or observations that come to mind, no matter how small.

The token can be found under the section labeled \"Bot\". You can refer to Discord's own documentation for details. Please note that you must keep the token secret, as anyone can control your bot if they obtain that token.\n\nWriting the bot's code requires some programming knowledge. If you are already familiar with a programming language, you should check whether a library for interacting with the Discord API already exists for that language. If you are not familiar with programming, or there are no libraries for your favorite language, some popular libraries include discord.py, discord.js and Discord4J for the Python, JavaScript and Java programming languages, respectively. You can refer to the libraries' documentation for details about their exact usage. In particular, you should choose a library that supports receiving voice from the voice channel, as all libraries do not support this feature.\n\nTo implement speech recognition for speech coming through a voice channel, you could have a buffer where incoming voice is continuously recorded. This buffer can then be sent to speech recognition and text classifier models of your choice. Finally, if a supported command was found, it can be invoked by calling the function implementing the command.\n\nAfter the bot's code has been written and tested, it can be deployed. As your bot uses speech recognition and text classification, it may require relatively high-end hardware to keep up with several people talking at the same time. Another option is to use cloud services for speech recognition and classification. In this case, hardware requirements are lower.

While they share some similarities in their basic principles, there are key differences in their design, use, and historical impact.\n\nDesign and Functionality:\n\n1. Bows are simpler in design, consisting of a flexible, curved piece of wood or composite material and a string connecting the two ends. The archer pulls back the string to bend the bow, storing potential energy that is released when the string is let go, propelling the arrow forward.\n1. Crossbows have a more complex design, with a horizontal bow-like assembly mounted on a stock. The user pulls back the string and locks it in place using a mechanism called a trigger or latch. When the trigger is pulled, the string is released, and the bolt is shot forward.\n\nHistorical Impact:\n\n1. Bows have a much longer history, dating back to the Stone Age. They have been used in many cultures around the world, including ancient Egypt, China, and Europe. Bows were the primary long-range weapon in many pre-modern armies, with skilled archers like the English longbowmen playing a critical role in medieval warfare. Bows have also played a significant role in hunting and sport, with modern archery competitions continuing this tradition.\n1. Crossbows emerged later, first appearing in ancient China around the 5th century BCE and later in Europe during the medieval period. Crossbows had a major impact on European warfare due to their ease of use, as they required less training and strength compared to traditional bows. This made them particularly effective for siege warfare and infantry combat. However, their slow reloading time limited their effectiveness on the open battlefield. Crossbows were eventually replaced by firearms as the dominant long-range weapon.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n\n1. Bows are generally lighter, faster to reload, and have a higher rate of fire compared to crossbows. However, they require more skill and physical strength to use effectively, particularly for long-range accuracy and power.\n1. Crossbows have the advantage of being easier to use, as they require less physical strength and training. Their design allows for more accurate aiming, and their shorter bolts can deliver powerful, penetrating force. However, crossbows are heavier, slower to reload, and have a lower rate of fire compared to bows.\n\nIn summary, bows and crossbows are both projectile weapons that have had a significant impact on hunting, sport, and warfare throughout history. Bows have a longer history and higher rate of fire, while crossbows are easier to use and deliver powerful shots. The differences in their design and use led to distinct roles in various historical contexts, with bows excelling in open battlefield combat and crossbows being more suited to infantry and siege warfare.", "label_value": 0.25, "index": 12911}, {"text": "Why did bows and crossbows become obsolete in the modern era?", "label_value": 0.16666666666666666, "index": 12912}, {"text": "It is believed that longbows became obsolete, because longbowmen required longer training, required higher strength to draw bowstring, and as a result could not be quickly used by conscripts.

While they share similarities, such as their basic function, there are significant differences between the two.\n\nHistorically, bows were first used as a hunting tool and then later as a weapon of war. The earliest evidence of bows dates back to the Paleolithic era, around 10,000 BCE. Bows were used extensively in ancient warfare, and many cultures developed their unique styles and designs. For example, the longbow became the most famous type of bow in England, and the composite bow was widely used in Central Asia and the Middle East. The bow remained a primary weapon in warfare until the advent of firearms.\n\nIn contrast, crossbows originated in ancient China and were developed as a hunting tool. It was later adopted for military use, and it became a popular weapon in medieval Europe. Crossbows had a more significant impact on warfare compared to bows since they were easier to use and required less physical strength to operate. Crossbows also had a more significant impact on medieval society, leading to the development of new technologies such as the windlass, a tool used to cock the crossbow.\n\nIn terms of functionality, bows are generally faster to shoot than crossbows but require more skill and strength to use. The archer must pull back the bowstring and hold it steady while aiming and releasing the arrow. Crossbows, on the other hand, require less skill and strength to use and can be held in a firing position for an extended period. Crossbows are also more accurate than bows because they have a trigger mechanism that allows for more precise aiming.\n\nIn conclusion, both bows and crossbows have a long and significant history and have impacted society in different ways. Bows were the primary weapon in warfare for thousands of years, and different cultures developed their unique styles and designs. Crossbows had a more significant impact on medieval society and warfare, leading to the development of new technologies.

In a panic, Roe interacts with other people at the port to ask if they can show them the next step. Unfortunately, everyone they talk to is too immersed in experience of the virtual world and cannot understand why they would want to leave.\n\nRoe continues to search for someone who is willing to help them. Standing at the end of one of the docks at the port, Roe sees a young woman who is waving her hands in strange patterns in the air. Curious about her odd behavior, Roe asks the young woman what she is doing. Surprised at the question, the young lady states that she is performing her exit sequence.\n\nFilled with hope, Roe begs the young lady to show them how to perform the exit sequence.

He would tell me about the farm he grew up on, the animals he fed, and the innocent, joyous life he led. Despite its innocuous nature and inherent simplicity, it was, and still is my favourite story of his. A subtle tip of the hat to the man he was. I suppose though that the real reason I am drawn to his story is how impossible it seems. How distant and unattainable that peacefulness truly is.\n\n\u201cHuuuuuhh!\u201d I breathed a deep, choking breath. My heart pounded like a dog on a chain, sweat dripping from my ears like there was no tomorrow. I looked up, still in a trance of adrenaline as my vision begun to straighten itself out. Panting for air, I unplugged myself and went to the kitchen to make a coffee, god I needed a coffee. Going in really takes it out of you, especially as that was my third time going in for the day.\n\"Hey\", Michelle, my wife, said as the walked into the room. The kettle clicked off.\n\"Yeah. Not to bad, holding up I guess\", I lied, choking back the truth that I didn't know how to express. She walked over to me, gave me a gentle, tender hug. She smelt like Laura, they wore the same perfume, that soft rosy essence with a sharp edge that I\u2019d grown to love, grown to rely on. I missed it. I craved it.\n\u201cYou know\u201d, Michelle started, \u201ctherapy is fine, its normal, it\u2019s\u2026everyone does it\u201d.

I could tell it was consuming her to.\n\nI picked up my coffee, sat back down on the couch and cried a little. A mans cry. The one that\u2019s been bottled up for too long, but isn\u2019t allowed to be seen. Laura. Out Laura. Dead. Everybody tells you grief is temporary, that it all ends, that there\u2019s light at the end of the metaphorical tunnel. But through the grey-tinted veil of sorrow I was seeing the world through, I refused to believe that were true. And so, for the fourth time that day, I plugged myself in, and visited the farm which my Dad had grew up on. That peaceful farm, that simple farm. A farm in a world before Laura existed, well before her untimely demise. Some people scream, some people bottle it all up. But I found coping easiest when I turned to my MiniMind. Anything I wanted to be, anyone I wanted to be, always. It was easier that way. And so, I embraced the denial, and paid another visit to the animals.\n\nMichelle stood leaning against the archway to the living room, watching her wreck of a husband drown himself in his virtual solitude. She knew he was getting worse. He was only in three times yesterday, once the day before. Now he was in for the fifth time today. And it was only two in the afternoon. She knew she should do something to help, she should not let him stay in, but maybe it was best for him? Maybe it would help? Her shoulders slumped and she let out an inaudible sigh. And she just stood there. Watching her husband drown in an oasis of opportunity, a world away. She just stood there for hours. And those hours eventually, turned to days.\n\nShe knew how dangerous that machine was, the MiniMind, it was an epidemic, really. The scientists said it was more addictive than heroin, and why wouldn\u2019t it be? It was a portal to a world without pain, without suffering. And her husband had been in there for days now. Without eating, without sleeping. And she didn\u2019t even have the stomach to intervene, because she knew, deep down, he was happy. And happiness was hard to come by. Much harder to maintain. She begged, silently, that he would come out by himself. That he would return to her and face the grief he was running from. To face his fear and beat it. \n\nBut that never happened. He just stayed in. And slowly, Michelle watched as the man she loved turned into a shadow of his former self, rotting in the false existence he created. Until he was no longer a man at all.
