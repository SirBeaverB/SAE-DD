More airflow and a cooler overall temperature may be required.\n\n\u2022 Storage space for items like food, water, leashes, and other dog supplies would need to be included. Perhaps special compartments or feeders designed for dogs.\n\n\u2022 The car interior would need to be very easy to clean and durable, as dogs may shed hair and get the interior dirty or muddy. Scratch-resistant and water-resistant materials may be preferable.\n\n\u2022 Any sensors or controls would need to be adapted for a dog's paws or nose since they do not have hands to easily press buttons or switches. Voice controls, touch controls, or other nose- or paw-accessible mechanisms could be employed.\n\n\u2022 Seat belts and other safety features would need to secure a dog safely in the appropriate spots, which would likely be on the floor or in specialized seats, not the standard human seats.\n\n\u2022 The overall styling, color, and branding of the car may need to be more playful or pet-focused to appeal to dog owners.

Additionally, the seats in a normal car are largely unsuitable for dogs.\n\nTo fix these issues, I would modify a human car as follows:\n- Replace the seat with a \"lay flat\" seat: it should be possible for a dog to lay facing forward and still see the road and operate the controls. Laying down like that will be the intended operating position.\n- Replace the steering wheel with a device that can be operated by a dog grabbing it with their mouth and turning their head. This would interfere with their ability to watch the road, so a very small adjustment in the device would need to translate to a large adjustment in wheel position. A downside to this design may be that it is fatiguing to operate for a dog.\n-  The brake and acceleration will be operated by pressure-sensitive pedestals instead of pedals. This is to accommodate the different seating position, as the pedestals will be at a similar level as the steering device. These pedestals are intended to be operated by the dog's left fore-paw.\n- The transmission will be operated by buttons accessible by the dog's right fore-paw.
