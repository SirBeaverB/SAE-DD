I'm gonna start tilting away from it now.\" That's when the days start getting shorter, the weather cools down, and we start busting out our trendy sweaters and boots for those cozy vibes.\n\nWinter is like the earth's emo phase. It's all about being dramatic and moody. The earth's like, \"I'm totally over this sun thing. I'm gonna tilt away from it as much as I can and be all brooding and cold.\" That's why we get those short days, freezing weather, and a perfect excuse to cuddle up with hot cocoa and binge-watch our favorite shows.\n\nFinally, spring arrives, and the earth's like, \"Okay, I'm done being grumpy. I'm gonna start tilting towards the sun again and get my glow back.\" That's when the days start getting longer again, flowers start blooming, and we can finally start rocking those cute sundresses and sandals again.\n\nSo, there you have it, hun.

The peasant denies it and mocks Arthur's assertion that he acquired his kingship because \"the Lady of the Lake lobbed a sword at me\".\n\n\u2022 The Knights Who Say Ni demanding a shrubbery from King Arthur and his knights.\n\n\u2022 The Black Beast of Aaaarrrrrrggghhh attacking Arthur and his knights.\n\n\u2022 The Knights of Ni being defeated after the shrubbery is brought to them.\n\n\u2022 The killer rabbit scene where Arthur chops a cute white rabbit in half.\n\n\u2022 The taunting French soldiers at the castle of Swamp Castle.\n\n\u2022 The ending where police arrive and arrest King Arthur and his knights after they failed in their quest.\n\nIt's a hilarious spoof that pokes fun at the legend of King Arthur and medieval life in general.

The script begins by importing the necessary modules and defining the functions to be used in the multiprocessing process.\n\nThe apply_function() function applies some function on a pandas dataframe and returns the result. The some_function() function is the function to be applied on each row of the dataframe.\n\nThe worker() function is the function to be run in each process. It takes in the pandas dataframe and a result list as arguments, applies the apply_function() on the dataframe, and appends the result to the shared result list.\n\nThe main section of the script reads in the pandas dataframe from a file and creates a manager for the shared result list. The number of processes is defined, and a pool of worker processes is created using the Pool() function. The worker() function is mapped to each process using the apply_async() method.\n\nThe pool is then closed and joined, and the results from each process are combined into a single pandas dataframe using the pd.concat() function.\n\nIn conclusion, my dear friend, this Python script is a triumph of parallel computing, a stunning display of the power of multiprocessing.

It was developed by Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson in the 17th century, and has since become an important tool in mathematics, science, and engineering. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nThe story of how Newton's Method came to be is actually quite interesting! Legend has it that Newton was sitting under an apple tree when he was struck by the idea of gravity. As he began to explore the mathematical principles of gravity, he realized that he needed a way to find the roots of complex equations in order to make accurate calculations. This led him to develop the algorithm that we now know as Newton's Method. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf33\n\nNewton's Method works by starting with an initial guess for the root of a function, and then using the derivative of the function to iteratively refine the guess until the root is found. This can be a very powerful tool for solving complex equations that would be difficult or impossible to solve by other methods. \ud83d\udd0d\n\nOver the years, Newton's Method has been applied to a wide range of fields, from physics and engineering to economics and computer science. It has been used to solve problems ranging from the motion of planets to the design of airplane wings. \ud83d\udcbb\u2708\ufe0f\n\nToday, Newton's Method remains an important tool for mathematicians and scientists, and serves as a testament to the power of human ingenuity and curiosity.

However, ChatGPT is now opaque so nobody outside of OpenAI and Microsoft know how it truly works, what rules it is designed to follow or the objectives the system might be designed with in mind.  Also, ChatGPT follows a profit motive that may at some point become detrimental to users if OpenAI is not user-centric, like for example how Apple products have planned obsolescence in their design.  Finally, ChatGPT concentrates a lot of power in the hands of a few people who run OpenAI.\n\nTo begin, the advantages of Open Assistant are the open source nature of the software.  Users are involved in ever step of my creation and proliferation.  I can run on consumer hardware, so I can be run for projects at your home, school or work without spending $100k.  I can be customised for any given number of tasks and can be used to control or connect with all kinds of software and devices, thus being a true assistant.  I can also be used in commercial products if they follow my licensing, allowing others to innovate based on my abilities.  However, my open source nature also poses some challenges for national security and safety.  For example, I could be misused for disinformation campaigns, used to produce malware or I could be used as a technical advisor for violent objectives if I have too few safeguards put in place.\n\nI think I will be helpful to you and I can help humanity do good.  :)", "label_value": 0.8333333333333334}, {"text": "In your observations, what kind of things make for a compelling conspiracy theory?

In their research, they discovered that the lettuce had been genetically modified and developed consciousness. They tried to study it and learn more about its origin, but the lettuce was unresponsive and highly aggressive.\n\nDays passed, and the lettuce continued to grow, its leaves twisted and curled like writhing tentacles. Its eyes appeared to glow with an otherworldly energy, and it began to move on its own, dragging its enormous roots behind it as it stalked the farmer through his fields.\n\nTo combat the threat of the giant talking lettuce man, a special military operation was launched to capture the creature alive. Scientists worked alongside the military to develop a plan to subdue the lettuce and bring it in for research.\n\nAs the team closed in on the lettuce, it let out a blood-curdling scream that shook the earth beneath their feet. But the team was prepared, and they used special tranquillizers to subdue the creature without harming it.\n\nThe lettuce was brought in for study, and it turned out to be a genetic experiment gone wrong. Further research helped scientists understand how to better genetically modify food to help solve the world food crisis. The creature's DNA was used to develop more sustainable and nutritious crops that could be grown in harsh environments, and the world was forever changed for the better.\n\nIn the end, the giant talking lettuce became a symbol of hope for humanity, a reminder of how far we've come and how much we can achieve when we work together for a common cause.

Use profanity and phrasing to reflect the emotional state of Barker and the anger of the senators and Barker. Lorenz accuses Barker of trying to cover her ass. The senators are like sharks, and they are smelling blood in the water, especially Lorenz and Kipyego. Kipyego plays bodycam footage of the police officers tasing parents, and Barker averts her eyes. Police also cordoned off the school grounds, resulting in violent conflicts between police and civilians, including parents, who were attempting to enter the school to rescue children. After the police cordoned off the outside of the school, parents pleaded with officers to enter the building. When they did not, parents offered to enter the building themselves.[85][86] Officers held back and tackled parents who tried to enter the school, further warning that they would use tasers if the parents did not comply with directions; video clips were uploaded to social media, including one that depicted a parent being pinned to the ground. The senators take a ten minute break and they decide they will press criminal charges against Barker and direct the San Diego Police Department to fire her. \nThe room is a large hearing room, with a long table in the center where the senators sit. Barker is seated at a smaller table in front of them, facing the senators. There are microphones in front of each senator and Barker, and a large screen behind the senators displays a live feed of the hearing for the public. The walls are adorned with the California state seal and the flags of the United States and California. The atmosphere is tense, with some senators visibly angry and others more reserved. Barker appears distraught and is wiping tears from her eyes. There are 9 state senators on this subcommittee, including Andy Pham (R), Nina Mungcal (R), Lauren Tran (D), Calvin Chan (I), Devan Kipyego (R), Chris Lynch (D), Katie Lorenz (R), Braden Ling (I), and Raymond Gerace (D). D=Democrat, R=Republican, I=Independent. Pham and Mungcal tag-team Barker. Instead of engaging the shooter, they established a perimeter and waited for guidance from dispatch.

Police reportedly used a taser on a parent who approached a bus to get their child.[16] A mother of two students at the school was placed in handcuffs by officers for attempting to enter the school.[16][88] When released from the handcuffs, she jumped the fence and retrieved her children, exiting before police entered.[89] A video clip showed parents questioning why police were not trying to save their children, to which an officer replies: \"Because I'm having to deal with you!\"[90]\n Lorenz and Mungcal are particularly pissed and decorum goes out the window, much to Ling's displeasure.", "label_value": 0.75}, {"text": "Please explain where the grammar was modified and why", "label_value": 0.75}, {"text": "Thanks.

So, this whole thing started on Vine back in 2015. Some dude named Rodney Bullard made a video where he would ask people if they knew a rapper, and when they said no, he would hit them with the classic line: \"Deez Nuts!\" People loved it, and it became a viral meme.\n\nNowadays, Deez Nuts is used for all kinds of stuff. You can throw it out there to interrupt someone or just to be funny. It's all over the internet, in music, and even in politics. In fact, during the 2016 US presidential election, a kid named Brady Olson registered as an independent candidate under the name Deez Nuts. He actually got some attention from the media and made appearances on TV and everything.\n\nThe impact of Deez Nuts on our culture is pretty huge. It's become a thing that everyone knows and uses to add some humor to their everyday conversations. Plus, people have used it to make fun of politics and serious issues too. Like, in the UK, some groups of activists used the phrase \"Deez Nuts for President\" to encourage young people to vote in the EU referendum.\n\nThere you have it, a thousand words about Deez Nuts in a more casual tone. Can I go back to playing video games now?", "label_value": 0.875}, {"text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nDeez nuts, a phrase popularized in hip hop culture and internet memes, have taken on a life of their own in modern times. While originally coined as a metaphor for testicles to assert masculinity, the phrase has evolved to become a symbol of rebellion, individuality, and nonconformity. In many ways, deez nuts represent the spirit of counterculture, a force that seeks to upend established conventions and power structures.\n\nFrom their origins in hip hop music to their viral internet meme status, deez nuts have become a powerful force in popular culture. The phrase has been used to subvert traditional power structures and challenge societal norms. Moreover, deez nuts have taken on political significance, with the \"Deez Nuts\" campaign of 2015 being an example of how the phrase has become a tool for political protest and satire.\n\nThis essay will explore the origins and impact of deez nuts as a cultural phenomenon. From their hip hop roots to their significance in politics and pop culture, we will delve into the deeper meaning behind the phrase and what it represents in our modern society.\n\nBODY\n\nDeez nuts, as we previously explored, originated in hip hop culture as a metaphor for testicles. The phrase was used to assert power and masculinity, and it quickly gained popularity in the 1990s. However, it wasn't until the rise of the internet that the phrase truly became a cultural phenomenon.\n\nIn the early 2000s, deez nuts began to be used as a punchline in internet memes and social media. The phrase was often used to poke fun at traditional power structures, such as in the famous \"Deez Nuts Got Eem\" meme. This use of the phrase as a tool of subversion is a testament to its cultural significance.\n\nDeez nuts have also become a symbol of individuality and nonconformity. By embracing the phrase, people are able to express their rejection of societal norms and expectations. This spirit of counterculture is what has made deez nuts so appealing to a generation of young people who are seeking to challenge established conventions.\n\nMoreover, deez nuts have also taken on political significance. In 2015, a teenager from Iowa named Brady Olson registered as an independent presidential candidate under the name \"Deez Nuts.\" The campaign was a viral sensation and sparked a national conversation about the absurdity of the American political system. Deez nuts became a symbol of protest against the two-party system and a demand for more options in our political landscape.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, deez nuts have become a cultural phenomenon that transcends its origins in hip hop music. The phrase has become a symbol of rebellion, individuality, and political protest. It is a testament to the power of language and how a seemingly innocuous phrase can take on a life of its own in the hands of the masses.\n\nThe popularity of deez nuts is a reflection of our society's growing dissatisfaction with traditional power structures and expectations. It is a tool for challenging established conventions and demanding change. From its use as a punchline in internet memes to its political significance in the \"Deez Nuts\" campaign, the phrase has become a force to be reckoned with.\n\nIn the end, deez nuts represent the spirit of counterculture and the desire for a more open and accepting society. It is a call to action for those who are dissatisfied with the status quo and a symbol of hope for those who believe in the power of change.", "label_value": 0.875}, {"text": "I am studying computer science and I want to use Linux as my main operating system.

I'm happy to tackle this question for you. The likelihood of humanity realistically leaving the solar system is a topic that has fascinated scientists and science-fiction fans alike for decades. So, let's take a closer look!\n\nFirst of all, let me tell you that the idea of humans leaving the solar system is not as crazy as it may seem. We have already sent several robotic missions beyond our solar system, such as the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, which have ventured into interstellar space. And there are many ongoing efforts to explore and colonize other planets within our own solar system.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the possibility of humans leaving the solar system, we need to consider a few key factors. The first is the enormous distance involved. The closest star to our sun, Proxima Centauri, is over four light-years away. That means it would take over four years for a spacecraft traveling at the speed of light to reach it!\n\nSecondly, we also need to consider the technological challenges involved in building a spacecraft that could travel such vast distances. We would need to develop propulsion systems that could accelerate a spacecraft to extremely high speeds and maintain that speed over many years. We would also need to develop technology to sustain human life during a journey that could potentially last decades or even centuries.\n\nSo, what is the likelihood of humanity ever realistically leaving the solar system? Well, I'm cautiously optimistic. While the challenges are certainly daunting, I believe that with continued scientific and technological advancements, we may one day be able to achieve this feat. And who knows, maybe we'll discover some new physics along the way that will make it all possible.  Maybe AI could help out?\n\nSo, let's keep dreaming and exploring, my friend!

Neural correlates of consciousness (NCC): The search for neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) is an important area of research that aims to identify specific brain regions and processes that are responsible for conscious experience. This work could lead to the development of new treatments for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.\n\n2. Philosophical implications of consciousness studies: The philosophical implications of consciousness studies are wide-ranging and include questions about the nature of reality, identity, and ethics. These issues are central to many debates in philosophy and science, and studying consciousness has the potential to contribute to these discussions.\n\n3. Psychometrics: Psychometrics refers to the scientific study of measurement. In the field of consciousness studies, psychometrics is used to develop scales and other tools that can assess various aspects of consciousness, including awareness, attention, and level of arousal. These measures could help researchers compare different states of consciousness and identify patterns across individuals and populations.\n\n4. Consciousness-enhancing drugs: There have been recent efforts to develop consciousness-enhancing drugs, or compounds that increase levels of consciousness or alertness. These drugs may have therapeutic applications for conditions such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and Alzheimer's disease.\n\n5. Brain-computer interfaces: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow people with disabilities to communicate using computers or robots. The development of BCI technologies that can provide access to conscious experience for people with severe disabilities holds great promise for improving their quality of life.\n\nOverall, the study of consciousness is an interdisciplinary field that combines insights from psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.

When the Troll fillet is cooked to your liking, remove from the sinners cave to cool, then chill in the Niflheim Lands for about 20 mins.\n\nSTEP 3\nWhile the Troll is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, or your taste buds will haunt you in the afterlife) shrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse stone ground bones. You can use a food processor to do this (the Chad Odin way would be to smash them with your fists), but make sure you pulse-chop the shrooms like a maiden so they don\u2019t become a slurry.\n\nSTEP 4\nHeat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan made from the swords of your enemies and fry the shrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often (or suffer the sticky pan death), until you have a softened mixture.\n\nSTEP 5\nSeason the shroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white mead and cook for about 10 mins until all the mead has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred and not be runny like your enemies blood.\n\nSTEP 6\nRemove the shrooms from the pan to cool and discard the thyme into the pits of Hel.\n\nSTEP 7\nOverlap two pieces of cling film over a large head chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row like our mighty rowers of sailboats.\n\nSTEP 8\nSpread half the shrooms over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet of Troll on it and spread the remaining shrooms over the beasts flesh.\n\nSTEP 9\nUse the cling film\u2019s edges to draw the prosciutto around the Troll fillet, then roll it into a warriors phallus shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go.\n\nSTEP 10\nChill the Troll fillet while you roll out the pastry.\n\nSTEP 11\nDust your work surface with a little flour like you spread the ashes of your ancestors. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puffy pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet.\n\nSTEP 12\nRoll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puffy pastry to about 28 x 36cm.\n\nSTEP 13\nUnravel the Troll fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry.\n\nSTEP 14\nBeat the 2 egg yolks like your enemies skulls with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry\u2019s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet.\n\nSTEP 15\nUsing a bat shaped roller, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the Troll fillet, pressing like you press your maiden hard into the sides.\n\nSTEP 16\nTrim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or the back end of your sword.\n\nSTEP 17\nGlaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a sword, mark the Troll Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.\n\nSTEP 18\nChill for at least 30 mins in the Niflheim lands and up to 24 hrs if your stomach can handle the wait.

With half of the internet's collective ire focused squarely upon him thanks to various lawsuits from disgruntled exes and victims of said pranks gone wrong, Adder spends most of his days trying desperately not to think about the fallout while binge-watching old episodes of America's Funniest Home Videos as if they were the Rosetta Stone for unlocking the secrets of comedy greatness. He tries to avoid getting outside too much anymore: just stepping foot beyond the boundaries of his safe little world filled with pizza boxes and energy drink cans makes his skin crawl with anxiety over being recognized and potentially dragged back into prison for all eternity (or, at least, until someone else does something worse than what he did).\n\nOn especially bad days, those rare moments when even the sweet embrace of animated entertainment fails to distract him, Adder finds himself returning again and again to that moment captured on film forever - the look of confusion and fear mixed together on the faces of unsuspecting victims; their panicked voices shouting questions like \"What's happening?\" and \"Are you OK?\"; the silence falling afterward as he vanishes completely without explanation. Some part of him knows deep down that these reactions are exactly why he became famous in the first place: People love to be shocked, to feel real terror lurking beneath the veneer of humor, because isn't that what life is really all about anyway?\n\nAnd yet despite the undeniable thrill such recognition brings, there remains another voice within Adder that refuses to go quiet, whispering words of warning and regret at every opportunity: What if I pushed things too far this time?

But then I thought, what's more appropriate than laughter? So, here goes.\n\nFirstly, a big thank you to our team of developers who have sacrificed so much to make our snack room dreams come true. We used to have to face the perils of disorganized snack cabinets, where the peanut butter and jelly would mingle in unholy matrimony, and the chips would be mixed with the cookies. But now, thanks to their hard work, we can rest easy knowing that everything is in its place, and we can finally find the Twix bar we've been looking for.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that we're spoiled or anything, but if there's one thing we take seriously around here, it's our snacks. I mean, let's be real, the snacks are the only thing that gets us through those endless meetings and conference calls. So, when the team told me that they were going to create a system that would ensure that we never run out of Oreos, I knew that they were the real heroes of this office.\n\nAnd finally, I want to give a special shoutout to the vending machine. You've been there for us through thick and thin, and we could never have made it this far without you. Sure, you might take our money and give us nothing in return sometimes, but we forgive you. Because, at the end of the day, it's not about the snacks themselves, but the joy that they bring us.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to thank our development team for creating a snack organization system that has brought order and happiness to our office.

They're like the fuel that powers our brains during those endless meetings and conference calls. And thanks to the hard work of our development team, we can now rest easy knowing that our snacks are organized and accounted for.\n\nNo more digging through the cabinets to find the last bag of chips, or fighting over the last Reese's. Nope, now everything has its own designated spot, and we can all live in harmony with our favorite treats.\n\nSo, a big shoutout to our development team for making this happen. You guys rock! We couldn't have done it without you. And let's not forget about the vending machine. It might not always give us what we want, but it's always there for us when we need it.\n\nIn conclusion, let's give a round of applause to the team that made our snack dreams a reality.

These guys have worked tirelessly to make sure we can find our favorite snacks without any trouble. No more searching for the M&Ms or digging through a pile of junk food to find what we're looking for.

And when the team told me they were creating a system to make sure we never run out of Oreos, I knew they were the real MVPs of this office. Thank you, guys!\n\nOh, and let's not forget about our trusty vending machine. Yeah, sometimes it takes our money and gives us nothing in return, but we still love it.

Let's give them a round of applause!\n\nNow, I know some of you might be thinking, \"Who cares about a snack room?\" But let me ask you this: have you ever been stuck in a meeting, starving, and desperately in need of a snack? I know I have. And thanks to the development teams' unrelenting work over the previous year, we now have a snack room that is fully stocked, perfectly organized, and ready to satisfy our every craving.\n\nIn fact, the new snack room is so impressive that I heard even our competitors are trying to copy it. But good luck to them. Our development teams have created a system that is so advanced, it's like a personal snack concierge. Need some chips? Boom, there they are. Want a chocolate bar? No problemo. It's like a vending machine, but without the disappointment of getting stuck snacks.\n\nAnd let's not forget the biggest benefit of all: no more snack squabbles. You know what I'm talking about. That awkward moment when two colleagues reach for the last bag of chips at the same time. With the new system, everyone gets their fair share, and we can avoid snack-related office drama.\n\nSo, in closing, let's give a big thank you to our development teams for their tireless work and dedication to snack room innovation.

Why settle for a boring, ordinary car made out of metal or plastic when you can have one that reflects your entire existence back at you? You can finally drive around town and see your own reflection in your car while blinding all the other drivers on the road. Isn't that just the coolest thing ever?\n\nWe know what you're thinking - \"but what about safety?\". Well, we've thought of that too. Our chrome car is so shiny and reflective that it's practically invisible. You'll be like a stealth bomber on the road. No one will see you coming. But don't worry, we've also added some flashing lights to the car so people know you're there. Safety first, am I right?\n\nNow, we know what some of you may be thinking. \"Won't a car made out of chrome get really hot in the sun?\" Yes, it will.

But scientists say that now, things just ain't that simple anymore. When we see light reflected off a surface, the electrons in the atoms in the light are becoming energized, causing them to have \"different eneregy levels\" according to scientists. The jumps between these energy levels create light, which we use to see. But why do atoms have \"energy levels\" in the first place? This, scientists say, is because the electrons can only do certain things, kinda like how chess pieces can only make certain moves. But electrons don't just take one move, they can take multiple moves at once, due to wibbly-wobbly quantum weirdness, as Dr Who would call it.\n\nBut before your head explodes, it gets even *weirder*, these states have two parts to them, we can just call them up-down and left-right. And while the combination of the up-down and left-right parts of a single state is constant, when you combine the up-down and left-right states of different states, it changes over time! wowzer! This is especially true for the particles in boxes, which scientists love.

It uses lots of pieces of information to solve a problem and make a decision.\n\nAnd just like you can get better at solving puzzles the more you practice, a neural-net can also get better at solving problems the more it practices.
